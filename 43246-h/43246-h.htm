<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>There have been many inquiries for this new
volume of the 'Motor Routes of England,' which
I should have been glad to publish a year ago had
the necessary time been at my disposal. Finding
that there was little chance of getting the book out
even this year, I obtained the help of Mr. Charles
H. Ashdown, who has written a considerable portion
of the letterpress under my supervision. We
motored over a great part of the routes together last
year, and part of North Wales, which I had no time
to visit, Mr. Ashdown motored through in my car
without me. Although he knew the country intimately,
I thought it better, from the motorist's point
of view, that he should go through the district afresh.
I hope, therefore, that, having taken great pains to
give the latest available information, this book will
prove of use to all who take their cars into Wales
and those parts of England which are included.</p>

<p>As in the previous volumes of this series, I am
<a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI"></a>
greatly indebted to the Secretary of the Touring
Department of the Royal Automobile Club for
his exceedingly kind assistance in working out the
routes. They are planned on the accumulated
experience of a great many members of the club,
who have placed their knowledge at the disposal
of their fellow-members.</p>

<p>My experience of the Daimler 38 h.-p. car in
which we toured through the greater part of Wales
and the adjoining English counties was, as before,
entirely satisfactory. We never had to give a
thought to the running of the car in the hundreds
of miles of mountainous roads we traversed.</p>

<p>Although the route maps accompanying the text
are generally sufficient for all the ordinary needs
of the touring motorist, I do not think it desirable
to travel without the sheets of Bartholomew's half-an-inch-to-the-mile
reduced survey maps. The
coloured contours are of such service in showing
the chief features of the surrounding country that
I always feel happier with them. The sheets required
for this book are numbered 8, 11, 12, 16, 17,
18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30.</p>

<p>I have been asked by those who have used the
previous volumes of this series to give a list of
<a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII"></a>
hotels, and in that printed at the end of this book
I give the names of those hotels I can recommend.
I shall be exceedingly grateful to any reader who
discovers any inaccuracies in this book if he will be
kind enough to let me hear of them.</p>

<p class="location">THE STARTING-POINT</p>

<p>The best and most direct route from London to the
finest scenery in Wales, as well as to many of the
most picturesque towns and districts in the western
half of the central or midland portion of England,
is the Holyhead Road. The older route books
invariably give the General Post Office as the
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
best starting-point, and this
has been indicated on the
route map on this page, and
that road beyond Barnet
is described, but as the
Edgware Road is so much
preferable in many ways,
the distances by that way
are given at the head of this
section. From the Marble
Arch the road goes as
straight as an arrow, passing
through Maida Vale, Brondesbury,
and Cricklewood.
The Welsh Harp Reservoir
is crossed, and the villages
of Edgware and Elstree
passed through, and the
road from Barnet is joined
at St. Albans.

</div>

<p>By the older route shown
in the map the first open
country is not reached until
Barnet is passed. Barnet
itself is now a suburban
town without any interest.</p>

<p class="location">MONKEN HADLEY</p>

<p>Upon leaving Barnet, a slight detour to the right,
occupying a few minutes, leads to Monken Hadley
Church, of varied styles of architecture. It stands
upon high ground near the road, and is picturesquely
surrounded by trees and pleasantly situated old
houses on a village green. The iron cradle beacon
affixed to the tower is an object of great rarity.
It was used in past times to signal the approach
of disturbers of the peace. A tall obelisk near
the church was erected early in the eighteenth
century to mark the site of the battlefield of
Barnet, 1471, immortalized in Bulwer Lytton's
'Last of the Barons,' and memorable for the
death of the great King-maker. A road with a
few easy turns in it leads back to the main route.
It passes <span class="wider">Wrotham Park</span>, the seat of the Rev.
the Earl of Strafford, whose family name is
Byng. Within one of the rooms the oak cabin
of the flag-ship once occupied by Admiral Byng
has been erected, conveyed thither when the vessel
was broken up. Since 1757, when the Admiral was
shot upon his own quarter-deck, <i>pour encourager
les autres</i>, no Byng has entered the navy, the
family having transferred its allegiance to the
army as a mild protest.</p>
<p><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></p>

<p class="location">SOUTH MIMMS</p>

<p>The church contains traces of Early English architecture,
but the main features are Perpendicular.
In the Frowyke Chapel, separated from the church
by a Perpendicular parclose screen, is a well-preserved
effigy of the Transition period and an
interesting brass let in the floor. The door to
the vanished rood-loft is in good condition, and
a low-side window may be found in the chancel.
Thomas de Frowyke, died 1448, is buried under
the tower; the inscription states that six sons
and twelve daughters furnished the matrimonial
quiver. The ecclesiologist with time upon his
hands will find an interesting church at North
Mimms, about two miles across country (see map),
standing in the grounds of an Elizabethan mansion.
From South Mimms a long and easy ascent leads
to the summit of Ridge Hill, where the massive
tower of St. Alban's fane comes into view in the
midst of a beautiful landscape. An equally long
and easy descent leads to a turn, where a cottage
stands upon the left, at some white gates. This
is the entrance to <span class="wider">Salisbury Hall</span>, a picturesque
moated grange of exceptional interest, with quaint
gables, twisted chimneys, and beautiful surroundings.
Originally built in the time of Henry VIII.
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
by Sir John Cutts, Treasurer of England, it subsequently
was occupied by the well-known Sir
Jeremy Snow. Nell Gwynn was often here, recouping
from Court revels, and tradition asserts
that Prince Charles sought refuge within its walls
after the Battle of Worcester. Visitors are generally
permitted to walk up to the farmyard to see the
front of the house. At <span class="wider">London Colney</span> a piece of
water is crossed. <span class="wider">Tyttenhanger</span> lies to the right,
at a distance of about two miles; it was the country
house of the Abbots of St. Albans, and has been
adapted to modern requirements. The road from
here to St. Albans is easy, but care should be
exercised at the cross-roads in the centre of the
town, where a policeman generally regulates traffic.</p>

<p class="location">ST. ALBANS</p>

<p>A walk through the cloisters opposite the Great
Red Lion Hotel affords a striking view of a
considerable part of the vast Abbey Church, the
most ancient of the great churches in England.
It stands upon higher ground than any other
cathedral in the British Isles, and is the longest
next to Winchester. It possesses, moreover, the
longest Gothic nave in the world. The Norman
tower, dating from 1077, is composed of Roman
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
bricks from the neighbouring <i>Verulamium</i>, and
flints, bricks, and stone from the same site may
be detected in the walls. The walk leads round
to the southern part of the church, through the
ancient sumpter-yard, with its fine old cedar, and
thence to the west front, the site of the demolished
monastery showing in irregular heaps upon the
left.
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></p>

<p><i>The nave is open to the public free of charge. Sixpence is
charged for entrance to the eastern portions (threepence each
for a party of ten). Open from</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="location"><i>Building Dates.</i></p>

<p class="hangingdbl"><i>Roman Period.</i>&mdash;St. Alban was executed upon
this spot, presumably in the amphitheatre,
in 303, and a church was erected to his
memory by the Christians of Verulam in
313, which was still standing in Bede's
time.</p>

<p class="hangingdbl"><i>793.</i> Offa the Great, King of Mercia, founded the
monastery, and either repaired and enlarged
the Romano-British church or built a new
one.</p>

<p class="hangingdbl"><i>1077.</i> Shortly after the Conquest, Paul de Caen,
a relative of Lanfranc, was appointed the
first Norman abbot, and proceeded to
demolish the church, subsequently erecting
a great Norman building in its place, the
remains of which&mdash;viz., the tower, transepts,
parts of the nave and the presbytery&mdash;still
remain.</p>
<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></p>

<p>On entering by the west front, which has been
rebuilt by Lord Grimthorpe, the first part of the
nave is Early English, dating from <i>c.</i> 1214, and
one of the best examples in England. Farther on
Norman bays, dating from 1077, are upon the
north, while opposite them are Decorated Gothic
bays, built <i>c.</i> 1323 to replace the Norman work
which had fallen. The screen has been despoiled;
it was erected in 1350. Passing through the door,
the abbot's entrance from the cloisters is seen upon
the right, and the south transept is reached, having
a curious feature, the slype of Transition Norman
work at the south end. The tower dates from
1077, and is the largest and heaviest of the Norman
towers now remaining in England. Eight of the
baluster columns round the triforia are from the
former Saxon church, and date from 793. The
choir-stalls are new, and above them is a remarkable
ceiling, the panels dating from 1368 to 1450. The
north transept is the reputed site of St. Alban's
martyrdom. In the presbytery is the high-altar
screen, only rivalled by that at Winchester, and
dating from 1484. It is the work of Abbot
Wallingford, was despoiled at the Reformation,
and recently restored by the late Lord Aldenham.
South of it lies the chantry tomb of Abbot Wheathampstead,
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
and north that of Abbot Ramryge.
Leaving by the north door, the presbytery aisle is
reached, partly Norman and partly Early English.
The old doors from the west front preserved here
date from the time of Henry VI. Proceeding eastwards,
the entrance to the Saint's Chapel is on the
right. Here is the far-famed shrine of St. Alban,
or rather the pedestal of the shrine, since the shrine
itself was portable, and rested upon the top of the
structure. It dates from 1306, was demolished in
1539, and built up in the three lancets at the east
end of the chapel. When the arches were opened
some time since, the fragments were recovered and
put together. The tomb of Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester (died, or murdered, 1447; see Shakespeare,
<i>Henry VI.</i>, Part II.), stands on the south
of the chapel; the coffin may be seen by raising
the trap-door. On the north side is the Watching
Gallery, where a monk sat to guard the shrine and
its treasures. It dates from <i>c.</i> 1400. There is
only one other in England.</p>

<p>Leaving by the north door again, the shrine of
St. Amphibalus, dating from 1350, is seen. It was
likewise demolished at the Reformation. The Lady
Chapel and its ante-chapel were erected between
1260 and 1320, and exhibit Early English and
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
Decorated architecture. They have been restored
under Lord Grimthorpe. Forty nobles who fell
in the first Battle of St. Albans are interred here.
At the Reformation the chapels were converted
into school premises for St. Albans Grammar
School, and used as such for 300 years. The stone
carving is particularly beautiful. Passing out by
the south door, an altar slab is seen, with its five
crosses; a grille, dating from <i>c.</i> 1270, which is the
only trellis screen in England; and upon the south
the openings to former external chapels. In the
Wheathampstead Chapel may be seen the brass of
Abbot de la Mare (1349 to 1396), reputed to be
the finest ecclesiastical brass in existence.</p>

<p>The <span class="wider">Great Gateway of the Monastery</span>, opposite
to the west front of the Abbey Church, dates
from 1361, and now forms part of St. Albans
Grammar School, one of the oldest, if not <i>the</i>
oldest, scholastic foundations in the kingdom. It
was probably founded in the reign of King Edred,
about 948, and among the eminent personages
attending it have been Alexander Nequam, foster-brother
of Richard I.; Matthew Paris, who left
the school in 1217 and entered the monastery; Sir
John Mandeville, the famous writer of his supposed
travels, who lies buried in the abbey; and Nicholas
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
Breakspere, born in 1090, who subsequently became
Pope of Rome, the only Englishman who has
attained to that dignity. In 1195 the school was
the largest in England. In 1381 the gates were
forced by the rioters in Wat Tyler's rebellion and
the precincts of the monastery invaded; and in
1480 the third printing-press in England was set up
in the building. Among post-Reformation scholars
one of the most distinguished was Francis Bacon.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the lane leading from the
monastery gateway is the well-known Fighting
Cocks Inn, reputed to be the oldest inhabited
house in Britain, and a few steps from it the River
Ver. Crossing the stream, the British causeway is
reached, one of the most ancient earthworks in
Great Britain, and the Roman walls lie just
beyond. The visitor here stands upon soil which
recalls memories of the earliest period in the
chronology of English history.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Verulamium.</span>&mdash;At the time of Cæsar's invasion,
54 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, Cassivelaunus was ruling over a great tract
of country, with his capital at <i>Verulamium</i>, the
home of a long line of ancestors. The Roman
general captured the city and exacted tribute. In
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 42 the town submitted to the Romans under
Aulus Plautius, but was sacked and burnt by
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
Boadicea and her followers in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 61. Rebuilt
and fortified with walls and towers, it was the first
Roman city built in Britain. Its area is 203 acres.
In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 58 Nero made it a <i>municipium</i>, or free city,
York being the only other town so honoured. It
was essentially a trading and residential city, and
became the capital of Southern Britain. In 303
St. Alban was led out of the gates and martyred
upon Holmhurst, where the Abbey Church was
subsequently erected. By 436 the Roman occupation
had ceased, and swarms of Picts and Scots,
Irish pirates, and Northmen overran the district.
Many battles were fought, and in 516 <i>Verulamium</i>
was sacked and burnt. It served as a quarry for
many hundreds of years, yielding building materials
for the monastery and town. The only Roman
theatre as yet discovered in Britain came to light
about fifty years since, and the foundations of the
largest building as yet unearthed in our islands
were revealed a few years ago. The thorough
excavation of the whole site is being mooted at
the present time.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Michael's Church</span> is of Saxon architecture,
dating from 948. It contains an Elizabethan pulpit
with hour-glass stand, and the tomb and statue of
Francis Bacon, Viscount St. Albans.
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></p>

<p>The <span class="wider">Two Battles of St. Albans</span> were fought
in 1455 and 1461, the first chiefly in St. Peter's
Street and its byways, and the second upon
Bernard's Heath, lying to the north of St. Peter's
Church, in whose churchyard many thousands of
the slain were interred.</p>

<p>The <span class="wider">Clock Tower</span> in the High Street dates
from 1410, and contains a medieval bell of beautiful
workmanship, <i>c.</i> 1403, the curfew bell.</p>

<p>Other objects of interest in St. Albans are Sopwell
Ruins, St. Stephen's Church, and Gorhambury,
two miles distant, the house of the Bacons.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Shortly after leaving St. Albans by the Redbourn
road, the River Ver is crossed at Bow Bridge, and
here the Watling Street from London, which has
passed through the centre of Verulam, joins the
road, and from this point until Chester is reached
the way lies almost entirely upon this great Roman
artery. It is intact from London to St. Stephen's
Church, St. Albans, and, with a few gaps, from near
Bow Bridge to Chester.</p>

<p>At <span class="wider">Redbourn</span> a few quaint old houses still
linger in the long, narrow street. To reach the
church, which is Norman and Early English,
a turn to the left is taken at the entrance to
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
the village. It contains a very fine chancel
screen.</p>

<p>Flamstead lies half a mile off the main road, at
the summit of a steep hill. The church has recently
been restored&mdash;a restoration in the true sense of the
word.</p>

<p>A long, steady rise through beautiful country
eventually leads to</p>

<p class="location">DUNSTABLE</p>

<p>The modern town is successor to the ancient
station of <i>Durocobrivæ</i> and a great Roman market,
the <i>Forum Dianæ</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-037" id="i-037"></a>
<img src="images/i-037.jpg" width="550" height="426" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Town Plan No. 2&mdash;Dunstable.</span></p>
<a href="images/i-037l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p>The district is remarkably rich in British and
Roman remains: Maiden Bower, a circular British
earthwork, and Totternhoe, a combined British and
Roman fort, lie at short distances from the town
(see <a href="#i-037">Map</a>). The Watling Street is crossed here in
the centre of the town by the Icknield Way, and a
piece of the Roman road was exposed near this
spot, which was 9 inches thick and intensely hard,
of cemented flints and sandstone.</p>

<p>Turning to the right, along Church Street (part
of the Icknield Way), the priory church, with its
beautiful west front, is seen upon the right.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Dunstable Priory Church.</span>&mdash;Founded 1131,
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
the church is but a fragment of that which formerly
stood here. Tower, transepts, chancel, and Lady
Chapel have disappeared, and even the nave, which
remains, has been curtailed. The body of Queen
Eleanor rested here in 1290 upon its progress to
London; and in 1533 Archbishop Cranmer held
his court in the church, and formally divorced
Queen Catherine of Aragon from the King. The
priory was dissolved in 1534. The greater part of
the building is Transition Norman, the chevron and
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
billet ornamentation being of excellent workmanship.
The north aisle is Perpendicular. In the
chancel are ten balusters of Flemish design and
execution. Undoubtedly the great feature of the
building is the exquisite west front, which, though
suffering in parts from recent restoration, still
delights the ecclesiologist. It contains four orders
of architecture, which effectually harmonize with
one another.</p>

<p>Mr. Worthington G. Smith, the eminent local
antiquary, has written a most admirable handbook
to the town, which will supplement these brief
particulars.

</div>

<p>Shortly after leaving Dunstable a long, easy
descent of the northern slope of the Dunstable
Downs occurs, these hills being part of the Chilterns.
A fine view over a large part of Bucks and
Beds is seen in front, and an interesting sweep of
the Downs behind. A number of sleepy little
villages occur, each presenting rural features of
its own in harmony with the surroundings. At
Hockliffe a side-road leads to the beautiful
Woburn Park and Abbey. At <span class="wider">Fenny Stratford</span>,
a small town chiefly consisting of one
street, the Roman station of <i>Magiovintum</i>
was situated, and coins and other remains are
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
frequently found; the only modern association
appears to be connected with Browne Willis, the
antiquary, who is buried here. The church is
early Georgian, dating from 1724. Seven miles
farther on, <span class="wider">Stony Stratford</span>, a small uninteresting
town, is reached, known chiefly in history
through having had an Eleanor Cross, which disappeared
in Puritan days, and also from the capture
of Edward V. by his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester.
<span class="wider">Bradwell Abbey</span>, founded in 1155, now a farmhouse,
lies about three miles away to the right.</p>

<p>From Stony Stratford to Towcester the route
runs as straight as an arrow, and one can imagine
the metalled track of the road the legions tramped
lying but a few feet beneath the surface. <span class="wider">Towcester</span>
is the ancient <i>Lactodorum</i>, and the later
Tove Castra, or Camp on the River Tove, which
flows through the town. Few, if any, Roman
remains are now visible, and Easton Neston House
with its picturesque park is the only feature of
interest in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The road to Weedon is somewhat undulating,
and rises in places to 500 feet above sea-level, an
altitude which has not been reached since leaving
Dunstable. At Weedon it is necessary to make
a detour to the left, as the Watling Street for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
some considerable distance has been allowed to fall
into disrepair; in fact, it is merely in some cases
a trackway through grassy fields, with farmers'
gates across the vanished road. The restoration
of this part of the Roman way has been proposed
at times, but never carried out, the considerable
cost and the paucity of towns and villages probably
accounting for it. This gap in continuity is
to be deplored for sentimental reasons, but not for
practical utility, as the track is at times more than
undulating.</p>

<p class="location">DAVENTRY</p>

<p><span class="wider">Daventry</span> is a small town possessing but few
attractions beyond its historic hotel, the Wheat
Sheaf, built in 1610, and known in the annals of
Warwickshire as the resting-place of Charles I.
(after the taking of Leicester) for six consecutive
days in 1645, the Royal troops, both horse and foot,
in considerable numbers occupying the surrounding
fields. The regal bedchamber may be seen and
even occupied, while the courtyard, famous in
duelling days, is visible from its window. In one
encounter in 1696 a young ensign, named Gardner,
gasped out his life after a duel to the death with
his lieutenant. Near Daventry lies Althorp Park,
the seat of Earl Spencer. In this medieval house,
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
not greatly altered since, James I. and William III.
were entertained.</p>

<p>On leaving Daventry the road turns sharply to
the right to <span class="wider">Kilsby</span>, with a poor surface most
of the way. It passes through a well-wooded
country, and a short distance beyond Kilsby
joins the Watling Street at an acute angle. Upon
looking backwards, the line of the ancient highway
may be distinctly traced through the fields. From
this point until Atherstone is reached, a distance
of nearly twenty-three miles, Leicestershire lies
upon the right-hand side of the road and Warwickshire
upon the left.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Dunsmore Heath</span> is then crossed, and shortly
afterwards two lines of railway are passed, the
source of the Warwickshire Avon being near the
first at Dove Bridge. At Churchover is the birthplace
of Cave, of <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> fame. The
main road from Rugby to Lutterworth branches
off to the right. Near this point, on the brow of
the hill, just north-west of Cave's Inn and on both
sides of the Watling Street, is the site of the great
Roman station <i>Tripontium</i>. The remains have
almost disappeared, but pieces of pottery are
plentiful, and coins are now and then unearthed.
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></p>

<p class="location">RUGBY</p>

<p>lies a few miles to the west of the main route, and
is famous for its great school, founded in 1567, being
one of the four great public schools in England.
The buildings are chiefly in the Tudor style, and
date from 1808, with many subsequent additions.
Besides the school, there are practically no objects
of interest in the town. The road to Lutterworth
is slightly undulating, with a good surface.</p>

<p class="location">LUTTERWORTH</p>

<p>is a quiet little country town of about 2,000 inhabitants,
lying in a pastoral district fissured occasionally
with wooded valleys. It is a typical foxhunting
centre. The main street descends a hill
somewhat abruptly, and crosses a small bridge
over the River Swift, from which point the ashes
of Wycliffe were scattered. The church is endeared
to the champions of Protestantism by its associations
with Wycliffe, and by the tangible relics
which are preserved in it of his residence here from
1375 to 1384. The architecture of the church is
chiefly of the fourteenth century. The nave is
early Perpendicular, but a Decorated window
occupies the end of the south aisle, where there
was formerly a Lady Chapel. The chancel also is
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
Perpendicular, with an Early English window and
door. It is thus somewhat difficult to point out
work which belongs to that period when Wycliffe
ministered in the building. The greater part of
the nave, however, may be thus assigned, and also
the fresco over the north doorway, showing a
queen between two kings. Over the chancel
arch is another fresco. The nave roof is Perpendicular,
but the pulpit, from which the reformer
preached, is the great object of interest, dating as
it does from a period anterior to Wycliffe's incumbency,
and is thus over 500 years old. A fragment
of a cope or chasuble is interesting as an undoubted
relic, but the chair, table, and wooden candlesticks
must be regarded with suspicion&mdash;the chair more
than the others. The 'Morning Star of the
Reformation' was buried in the chancel, where
his remains rested for thirty years; they were then
dug up, burnt, and cast into the river.</p>

<p>The road from Lutterworth, rejoining the
Watling Street, emerges at the <span class="wider">Cross-in-Hand</span>,
where care must be taken in the selection of the
right road. From Cross-in-Hand to High Cross
there is nothing of particular moment, but at the
latter place, where five roads meet, was one of the
most important junctions of Roman highways for
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
the Watling Street. It is crossed here by the
Foss Way coming from Gloucester, and leading
through Leicester to Lincoln. The great station
of <i>Venonæ</i> or <i>Benones</i> was situated here, but has
entirely disappeared. Taking the road marked
'To Holyhead,' the road leads over Smockington
Hill, and a few miles farther on a turning on the
left to Nuneaton (two miles off the main road)
is reached.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Nuneaton</span> lies in the centre of the 'George
Eliot' country, and is the Milverton of the novelist,
while Chilvers Coton near it figures in 'Scenes of
Clerical Life,' and 'Oldinport' may be traced in
'Newdegate,' the family name of the residents at
Arbury Hall, a delightfully situated country-seat
a few miles to the south-west of the town. Beyond
this Nuneaton possesses no special features, except
a church built in the Decorated period, and another&mdash;St.
Mary's&mdash;a modern replica of the Abbey
Church which formerly occupied the site.</p>

<p>The spire of <span class="wider">Hinckley Church</span> is now seen
upon the right, six miles to the north of which
lies the <span class="wider">Battlefield of Bosworth</span>. The North
Warwickshire Coalfield has now been reached, and
in the high ground upon the left there is an
interesting geological district. The stone quarries
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
worked there were formerly supposed to produce
Millstone Grit of the Carboniferous formation, but
which has recently been proved to be pre-Cambrian,
and necessarily the most ancient of rocks. <span class="wider">Hartshill</span>
is in this district; it is the birthplace of Michael
Drayton, and contains a few ruins of a Norman
castle dating from 1125. To the right of the
Watling Street lies Fenny Drayton, where George
Fox, the founder of the sect of Quakers, was born.
Before entering Atherstone the small village of
<span class="wider">Witherley</span> is passed upon the right, and the River
Anker here divides the site of the great Roman
station of <i>Manduessedum</i> into two parts. The name
has been anglicized into <span class="wider">Mancetter</span>. The oblong
earthwork yet remains, about 630 feet long and
440 feet broad. The church stands on the ruins
of the western side of the camp. Many coins have
been found here, and great masses of Roman
masonry lie beneath the soil. The summer camps
lie upon the adjacent hills. The first turning on
the left, after passing the bridge, leads in a few
minutes to Mancetter Manor House, originally
built in 1135, and presenting a quaint Edwardian
appearance at the present day. In 1432 the Glovers
occupied it, one of whom suffered martyrdom in
the Marian persecution.
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></p>

<p class="location">ATHERSTONE,</p>

<p>a singularly uninteresting looking town, whose
staple manufacture is felt hats, has a long,
straggling street, a portion of the Watling Street,
and during sewage operations about fifty years ago
the remains of the original Roman road came to
light, at some depth below the present surface;
some of the paving-stones, grooved by chariot
wheels, were in places cemented together. Henry
of Richmond slept at the Three Tuns Inn, now
demolished, the night before Bosworth Battle, and
heard Mass in the church, which is not of great
archæological interest.

</div>

<p>At <span class="wider">Atherstone</span> the railway is passed by a
bridge, superseding a former level-crossing. Immediately
to the left a road leads to the site of the
almost demolished <span class="wider">Merevale Abbey</span>, the chapel
of which is still used as a parish church, and contains
recumbent effigies of the Ferrers family. The
road to Fazeley is undulating and uninteresting.
To the south of the town lies <span class="wider">Drayton Manor</span>,
the seat of the great Sir Robert Peel. Here one
is forcibly reminded by ocular evidence that this
is a mining district. A turning to the right leads to</p>

<p class="location">TAMWORTH,</p>

<p>one of the most ancient towns in Warwickshire
and Staffordshire, for it stands in both counties.
It was a royal residence in the time of the
Heptarchy, and from that remote period to the
present time the castle has been of more or less
importance&mdash;in fact, it is one of the most ancient
buildings in Central England. The mound upon
which it stands is of British origin; Queen Ethelfleda
(died 918) erected the castle which, with many
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>
alterations and additions, meets the view at the
present day. It has recently been acquired by the
Corporation, and is open to visitors. The ancient
causeway leading to the entrance presents the
finest example of Saxon 'herring-bone' masonry
to be found in the kingdom. The circular keep is
of picturesque red sandstone, which does much to
mitigate the effect of the Perpendicular windows.
The venerable building was the home of the
Marmions, the Frevilles, and the Ferrers, and in
'Marmion' we find:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'They hailed him lord of Fontenaye,</p>
<p>Of Lutterward and Scrivelbaye,</p>
<p class="i1">Of Tamworth Tower and Town.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last of the Marmions died in 1291. The
bases of the dungeon walls are four yards thick,
and a visit to the castle interior gives the impression
of massive solidity.</p>

<p>Tamworth Church, founded in the eighth century,
was destroyed by the Danes in 874, and rebuilt by
King Edgar. In 1345 it was burnt, but rebuilt.
The crypt and two Norman transept arches remain
of the early building. The late Perpendicular
tower contains a curious double staircase, and is
a prominent feature for many miles round.
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></p>

<p class="location">LICHFIELD</p>

<p>The road to Lichfield lies by the side of the
River Tame for some distance, but it passes
through a colliery district; some finely wooded
knolls, however, occur on either side of the road.
About three miles before reaching the city the
barracks are seen upon the right, with an extensive
common for training purposes; at the same time
the three Cathedral spires, 'The Ladies of the
Vale,' form an attractive feature in the landscape.
The road leads directly to the <span class="wider">Cathedral</span>, which is
one of those exquisitely pretty ecclesiastical edifices
which one wishes to put under a glass case for
preservation from the elements. It has been the
seat of a bishopric since the seventh century, and
is connected with St. Chad. A Norman church
succeeded the Saxon edifice, but has entirely disappeared.
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
The earliest part of the present building,
the west choir, dates from <i>c.</i> 1200; the south
and north transepts followed, and the nave and
west front date from about 1275. The eastern
parts were finished in 1325. The central spire was
destroyed during the Civil War, and rebuilt by
Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Cathedral is open to the public from 9.30
to 5 on weekdays.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-054" id="i-054"></a>
<img src="images/i-054.jpg" width="550" height="379" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.<br />
It is one of the smaller cathedrals, but its workmanship is of an exquisite richness.</p>
</div>

<p>Upon entering the west front, which is one of
the most beautiful in England in the Decorated
style, the Early English nave with dog-tooth
mouldings, the clustered pillars, and the fine vaulting,
impress one by their beauty and gracefulness.
In the north transept one finds five lancet windows,
with Perpendicular examples on either side. In
the south transept the vaulted roof, with its huge
bosses, and the large Perpendicular window are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
special features, and here the rich stained glass and
the warm appearance of the red sandstone produce
an effect upon which the eye delights to dwell.
The choir, with its side aisles, richly vaulted roof,
and huge windows springing from the triforium,
at once attract the visitor's attention. The early
Decorated blank arcading of the aisles is interesting,
as is also the peep afforded into a building upon the
south side. In the south aisle of the retro-choir
a celebrated monument, the 'Sleeping Children,'
touches a chord that vibrates in the nature of all
who possess the tenderness of human sympathy.
The Lady Chapel has rich Decorated arcading
upon its walls, from above which spring nine
windows with trefoil tracery. In seven of these is
the stained glass that once adorned the great Cistercian
nunnery of Herckenrode, in the Bishopric of
Liège. It dates from 1530, and was brought to
England after the suppression of the nunnery in
1802. Although one of the smallest of English
cathedrals, Lichfield is singularly impressive by
reason of beautiful details and graceful proportions.
Although actually situated in a valley, its site is
the highest in England, with the exception of
St. Albans.</p>

<p>In the Market Square stands the statue of
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
Samuel Johnson, opposite the house in which the
great lexicographer first saw the light.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In order to rejoin the Watling Street, the road
marked 'To Cannock' should be taken, and about
one and a half miles from the city a turning to the
right leads to that place. Continue, however, in
the same straight line for another one and a half
miles, and the Watling Street will be struck,
leading off to the right at Muckley Corner. The
Roman station of <i>Eteocetum</i> lies about one mile
to the south-east at Wall, where the Rycknield
Street starts for the North. This is missed by
the detour to Tamworth and Lichfield.</p>

<p>Near Brownhills Common a large piece of water&mdash;Cannock
Chase reservoir&mdash;lies to the right, and
farther on another reservoir is passed. Two miles
beyond Gailey railway-bridge is the site of the
Roman station of <i>Pennocrucium</i>, near a roadside
inn, and immediately afterwards the Shropshire
Union Canal crosses the road by an aqueduct.
Boscobel House and Park lie about a mile towards
the south, with the famous oak in which Charles
hid himself after Worcester. A straight run of
seven miles passes by Weston Park, renowned for
its beauty, and brings one to a turning on the left,
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
the main road to Shifnal. It is advisable to pass
through Shifnal and regain the Watling Street
farther on, and thus avoid the extremely bad road
between Redhill and Oakengates.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Shifnal</span> is an interesting little town, possessing
many quaint old timbered houses, with overhanging
upper stories, often enriched by carving.
A turning to the right in the middle of the
town leads to the <span class="wider">Church</span>. It possesses many
curious remains of Norman architecture, among
which are the chancel arch and a portion of
the south transept. The main structure is Early
English and Decorated, the tower arches being
of the former period. The tomb and effigy of the
Prior of Wombridge, 1526, and some Elizabethan
monuments are in the chancel. Over the south
porch is a parvise, which projects in a novel
manner into the church, and is supported there
upon two pillars.</p>

<p>From Shifnal to Oakengates, the reputed site
of <i>Uxaconium</i>, is mainly downhill, and through
a colliery district, with all the usual concomitants
pertaining to it. After a run of about six miles,
during which the Wrekin, 1,335 feet high, lies to
the left, a turning at an inn is reached leading to
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></p>

<p class="location">WROXETER</p>

<p>This is the ancient <i>Uriconium</i>, destroyed by fire in
the fifth century, and the imposing Roman remains
form one of the chief attractions for visitors in the
immediate vicinity of Shrewsbury. To the archæologist
it is of supreme interest, as an immense
variety of Roman remains have come to light,
including many parts of the massive walls, the
basilica and public baths. There are also exposed
to view well-preserved examples of the hypocausts
of villas. Should a detour be made to the site of
this important Roman town, the largest encountered
since leaving <i>Verulamium</i>, a good road will be found
leading back to the main route, and thence to
Shrewsbury. Continuing on the main road, one
crosses the Severn, and keeps it for some time
upon the right hand. Entering Shrewsbury, the
centre of the town is approached by a steep hill,
1 in 10, where caution must be exercised on
account of the traffic.</p>

<p>Leaving Shrewsbury by the Battlefield Road,
and passing through the unprepossessing parts of
the old town, the church standing upon the site of
the battle becomes a conspicuous object when the
higher ground is reached, about a mile from the
town. This remarkable memorial of the terrible
slaughter which took place in 1403 is necessarily of
the Perpendicular period, and at the present time
is a simple parish church, to which flocks a congregation
eminently agricultural. Restorations have
taken place at various periods, but sufficient remains
of the original to make it of great interest. The
site is that upon which the fiercest part of the
battle occurred, and where, after the fight, the dead
were crowded by hundreds into vast pits; for the
slaughter upon that fatal day was tremendous,
numbering probably 8,000 men. The army of
Glendower, the Mortimers, and the Percies lost
5,000 men by the most moderate estimate, and
that of the victor, Henry of Bolingbroke, was but
little less, chiefly owing to the deadly accuracy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
the Cheshire bowmen of Percy's army, who at first
almost succeeded in winning the fray. But the
King's army was double the number of his opponents,
and that always told in a civil war. For three hours
before sunset the struggle waged round the site of
the church, and when at last Percy's army broke
and fled, they made for Wem to the north, or
the higher, wooded ground to the east. The
road to Whitchurch passes through Wem, from
which Hawkstone Park may be seen towards
the west upon high ground, and the obelisk to
Rowland Hill. The scenery upon the route is
eminently characteristic of English pastoral life,
with farmsteads and cottages nestling in charming
seclusion amid a wealth of foliage, or upon the
summits of the small undulations which diversify
the Shropshire plain. At intervals stretches of
heath alternate with the cultivation, while along
the whole route the Welsh mountains form a
broken sky-line to the west.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Whitchurch</span> is a busy country town with a
market, and forms a centre for the trade of the
district. The remains of the castle which once
existed here were visible down to 1760, but now
no traces can be seen.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church.</span>&mdash;The old church of Whitchurch
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
fell in 1711, and the edifice built upon the site is in
heavy Romanesque architecture. There are monuments
in it to the Earls of Shrewsbury, one in
armour being representative of John, the first Earl,
who was killed at Bordeaux in 1453, and whose
remains were brought from France to be interred
here.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Whitchurch, Overton Scar
forms a conspicuous feature in the landscape,
lying to the left near the vale of the Dee.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Cholmondeley Castle</span>, three miles to the west
of Malpas Station, is the seat of the Marquis of
Cholmondeley, and is situated in the Peckforton
Hills. The younger son of David le Clare settled
here in Norman times. The present castle is a
modern building erected in the Norman style,
while the old hall, of Elizabethan foundation, was,
unfortunately, placed in the hands of Vanbrugh for
restoration, and became so completely altered in
appearance that one would hardly guess its origin.
The district lying around these hills was the scene
of many encounters between the Royalists and
Parliamentarians. Near Broxton Station stands
<span class="wider">Carden Hall</span>, one of the most beautiful examples
of timbered mansions in the country. It was built
in the time of Elizabeth, but the Cardens were
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
here in the reign of Henry VIII. The Hall was
garrisoned by the Royalists, but after being captured
by the other side was plundered, like most of the
mansions in this county. About a mile farther
on <span class="wider">Aldersey Hall</span> stands to the left, about ten
furlongs from the road. It is asserted that it has
been occupied by the family of that name since the
Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>In <span class="wider">Handley Church</span> a good brass may be seen
of the Venables family, and <span class="wider">Calveley Hall</span>, once
a manor-house and now converted into a farmhouse,
has a good oak staircase and some excellent
wainscotting in the rooms.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Rowton Moor</span> is reached next, where the
Royalists suffered a defeat in 1645. The road
passes through the battlefield.</p>

<p class="location">CHESTER</p>

<p>From Shrewsbury the road into Chester leads
into Foregate Street, and presently, after passing
through a street of uninteresting suburban character,
the city proper is entered by the east gate in the
walls, the archway of which passes over the road.
Upon the left is the Grosvenor, a comfortable and
well-managed hotel, conveniently situated as a
centre for seeing the many features of interest in
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
Chester. The journey from London along the
Watling Street has been upon the track of the
Roman legions, and here at Chester&mdash;the ancient
Deva&mdash;is found the ultimate object of their
journey, for this was the headquarters of the
famous Twentieth Legion, which occupied the
town shortly before the Boadicean Rebellion in
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 61, and remained there until the evacuation
of Britain in the early part of the fifth century.
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
The old town is suggestive of Rome's imperial
power, for the ichnography of the city to-day
resembles in a remarkable fashion the great military
castra of the conquerors of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-069" id="i-069"></a>
<img src="images/i-069.jpg" width="550" height="448" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plan of Chester Cathedral.</span><br />
<i>Based on that published by the late Dean Howson.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of the first objects of interest is the
<span class="wider">Cathedral</span>, situated about two minutes from
the hotel by passing up Werburgh Street. It
is one of the red cathedrals, and owing to the
sandstone of which it is composed being of a
friable nature, the veneering of the edifice with
new stone unfortunately deprives it of that
aspect of age so characteristic of the majority
of the great churches of England. The earliest
building standing on the site is said to have been
put up in the second century, but of that no
traces exist. The present structure dates from the
twelfth century, and has architecture as recent
as the sixteenth. Upon entering by the west
door some Norman work is apparent at the end
of the nave, but its general style is Perpendicular;
there is no triforium, and the fenestration
springs directly above the arches, where an unornamental
balustrading breaks the junction. The
huge Perpendicular window at the west end is not
of any particular merit. The large south transept
was until recently used as a parish church, and is
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
remarkably spacious; it is late Decorated, and
possesses beautiful tracery in the window of the
west aisle. Passing into the choir, which is early
Decorated, and has been completely restored, one
finds some exquisite work in the canopies of the
stalls, which are undoubtedly the finest in the
kingdom. Especially interesting are the quaint
misereres; the Bishop's throne and pulpit are,
however, modern. A characteristic feature of
architecture occurs in the triforium, where four
arches are superposed upon each of the bays below
them. In the north aisle wall are preserved some
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>
magnificent mosaics, presented to the cathedral in
1886. The screen across the choir is Perpendicular,
and of singular beauty, but it prevents the eye from
perceiving the full length of the church, making it
appear shorter than is actually the case. The
north transept is small, with Norman work below
and Perpendicular above. It will readily be seen
that there are two periods in the Norman work.
The large tomb on the floor of this transept is the
resting-place of Bishop Pearson, who died in 1696.
He is well known for his work on the Creed. The
cloisters are entered through a Norman doorway at
the east end of the north wall of the nave; the
style throughout is Perpendicular, and the work on
three sides of the square is picturesque; the south
side, which had perished, has been rebuilt. An
early Norman passage lies along the west side of
the cloister. The chapter-house, which may be
entered from this spot, is exceptionally worthy of
a visit. It is of Early English architecture and
a beautiful example of the style; the vestibule is,
perhaps, more chaste than the chapter-house, and
the manner in which the mouldings of the pillars
run up unbroken into the vaulting is a striking
feature.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the cathedral by the same door
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
at the west front and turning to the right, the
imposing Town Hall is seen in Northgate Street,
and opposite to it is the abbey gateway, a fine
example of Norman and Early English work,
deserving more than a passing glance. Continuing
up Northgate Street, the <span class="wider">Town Walls</span> are reached,
and can be climbed by steps; the masonry here is
probably of Roman origin. A few paces to the
right lead to the Ph&oelig;nix Tower (<i>entrance 1d.</i>),
from the summit of which Charles I. witnessed the
defeat of his troops on Rowton Moor, September 27,
1645, and not September 24, as stated on the tablet.
Retracing one's steps, the Shropshire Union Canal
lies below, occupying a portion of the ancient moat.
The raised platform upon the right which is now
encountered affords a very fine view of the surrounding
country, and beyond is the Half-moon
Tower, called 'Pemberton's Parlour.' From here
the battlements lead to Bonwaldesthorne's Tower,
now used as a museum, and upon the level sward
below the visitor may perceive a number of
Roman remains, including a hypocaust, or warming
apparatus, altars, and other remains. The projecting
isolated defence at this point is known as
the Water Tower. Continuing the walk, the well-known
racecourse, called the 'Roodee,' or 'Isle of
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
the Cross,' is seen upon the right, enclosed by a
loop in the river, and presently the group of
buildings, consisting of the assize courts, gaol,
and barracks, appear upon the left, the whole
being classified under the name of 'the Castle.'
The picturesque old bridge is next encountered,
and here it is advisable to leave the walls, as the
remainder of the route is devoid of interest.</p>

<p>Passing up Bridge Street, the third turning upon
the right is Pepper Street, and after traversing
this strangely named thoroughfare, the <span class="wider">Church of
St. John the Baptist</span> is soon reached, one of the
most interesting buildings in the city. It was
originally intended to be the cathedral for the
former diocese, which embraced practically the whole
of Mercia, but the dignity was conferred upon
Coventry. The ruins consist of very picturesque
Norman work, with Norman and Early English
flanking arches. By applying to the sexton, who
is usually in the church, the Norman crypt may
be visited. The nave of the church has Norman
cylindrical pillars, dating from about 1090; the
triforium arches are Early English of about a
century later. A very fine lancet window is at
the west end. The central tower fell in 1574, and
crushed the east end of the church, which has
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
never been rebuilt. The base of the tower shows
rich Norman arches, with clustered columns supporting
them. Traces of frescoes may be seen
here. There are many displaced monuments now
resting at the west end; one, a knight, dates
from <i>c.</i> 1240, and a lady from <i>c.</i> 1400.</p>

<p>Retracing one's steps through Pepper Street, and
passing up Bridge Street, <span class="wider">St. Peter's Church</span> is
reached. It was built on the site of the Roman
Prætorium, and in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 907 the Church of
SS. Peter and Paul was removed here by Ethelfleda
from the site of St. Werburgh's. The edifice is
mentioned in Domesday as the Church of St. Peter.
The rectors' names are preserved from 1195. The
church is square in plan, and consists only of four
aisles; the architecture is Perpendicular, and rude
Georgian galleries disfigure two of the aisles. The
far-famed <span class="wider">Rows</span> of Chester may be visited from
this point; they are found in Eastgate Street and
Bridge Street in particular, but Watergate Row
should on no account be missed, because two
houses of the south side are striking specimens of
seventeenth-century architecture. One bears the
inscription 'God's Providence is mine inheritance,'
which is supposed to allude to the preservation
of the family occupying it from the plague.
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>
On the same side, No. 11, is a remarkable medieval
crypt, now occupied by Quellyn Roberts and Co.,
wine merchants, who readily allow visitors to
descend into the vaulted chamber.</p>

<p>This list of interesting sights of Chester is by
no means exhaustive; an exploration of the streets
in almost any direction will afford glimpses of
old-time quaintnesses nestling in unsuspected byways,
and the eye can dwell with pleasure upon
many architectural details and rich colour schemes.

</div>

<p>On leaving Chester the Grosvenor Bridge is crossed,
and as far as Saltney the road is occupied by tram-lines,
while on looking backwards a fine view of the
city walls is obtained. After Saltney an excellent
road through the marshes enables one to see the
wide estuary of the river; but at Broughton, where
the left-hand road should be taken, a stiff rise of
two miles leads to a plateau with an average elevation
of nearly 500 feet above sea-level, upon which
the road remains for the next twelve miles. The
country here is well wooded, and Halkin Mountain
presents a fine appearance in front. The outskirts
of a small colliery district, with its centre at
Buckley, are passed near Padeswood, and presently
Mold, the county town of Flint, is reached.</p>

<p class="location">MOLD</p>

<p>The town, which is rather sleepy and depressing,
contains a church at the summit of a steep hill to
the right, thoroughly rebuilt in the florid Tudor
period early in the sixteenth century. The nave
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
has some ornate four-centred arches, and in the
chancel some reputed eighth-century work has
been incorporated.</p>

<p>Behind the
church is the commencement
of the
ascent to Bailey
Hill, an eminence
partly natural and
partly artificial. It was once a British fortress,
and was subsequently occupied by a medieval
castle, now entirely vanished, and pleasure-grounds
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
occupy the site. In the immediate neighbourhood
of Mold there are many objects of considerable
interest to the antiquary and geologist, such as the
site of the 'Alleluia Victory,' won by an army of
Christian converts under Germanus, and who, by
shouting 'Alleluia!' struck the Picts and Scots, to
whom they were opposed, with panic. In 1833 a
gold breastplate of Celtic workmanship was unearthed
near the town, and is now a treasured
object in the British Museum. The ascent of
Moel Fammau, 1,823 feet, the highest peak in the
Clwydian range, from which a magnificent panorama
is obtained, is easily accomplished from this town.
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></p>

<p>Mold was once a flourishing place, with mines
and smelting-works in its vicinity, but they have
now become unprofitable, with the inevitable result
of lowering the vitality of the town. The road
leading to St. Asaph passes a few coalpits near
Mold, but presently winds about in a valley between
the Clwydian Range and the Halkin Mountain.
The village of <span class="wider">Cilcain</span> lies to the left of the route,
at a distance of two miles, on the lower slopes of
Moel Fammau, and is noted for the magnificent
carved oak roof of its church, brought from Basingwerke
Abbey, near Holywell. Nature is now in
her pleasantest mood, and as the road winds with
many a sharp turn down the long slope towards
<span class="wider">Caerwys</span>, the mountains on both sides become
softened and rounded, and clothed in many parts
with trees to their summits. Upon the hills to the
left lie a succession of interesting British camps, the
strongest and most extensive being Moel Arthur,
1,494 feet, reached just before Nannerch appears
by a road which branches off close to a stone circle.
<span class="wider">Caerwys</span> is believed to have been a Roman station.
It was at one time celebrated for its meetings of
the bards, or Eisteddfodau, and also as being the
residence of the last native Welsh Prince, Llewelyn
ap Gruffydd. The whole of this district is rich in
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
memories of the past, and abounds in interest.
After passing Bodfari, where the railway crosses
the road, a bridge over the River Clwyd is reached,
and directly afterwards the turn to the right should
be taken. (That to the left leads to Denbigh.)</p>

<p>At this point one says good-bye to the track of
the Roman legions, <span class="wider">Bodfari</span> (<i>Vara</i>) being the last
of the stations to be passed. The Roman road
went straight ahead towards the west, and finished
at <i>Segontium</i>, which will be seen when passing
through Carnarvon. Thus, nearly all the way,
from St. Albans through Shrewsbury to Chester,
the Watling Street has been followed.</p>

<p class="location">ST. ASAPH</p>

<p>This small village-city of 2,000 inhabitants is of
consequence only on account of its cathedral, conspicuously
placed upon high ground, and a prominent
feature for many miles. To reach the time when
this ancient see did not exist, one must travel back
before the sixth century. The first building, of
wood, was destroyed by fire in 1282, and the edifice
which succeeded it was nearly razed to the ground
during the wars under Owen Glendower. The
present church practically dates from 1482; the
choir, however, was not completed until 1770. It
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>
was restored by Sir Gilbert Scott. St. Asaph is
the smallest British cathedral, being 182 feet long
and 68 feet across the nave. The interior presents
the aspect of a spacious parish church, and possesses
only a few objects of interest. The east window is
Decorated, and the tracery of the side-windows
based upon traces of Early English work. The
effigy of an Abbot in Episcopal robes, and probably
dating from the fifteenth century, lies in the south
transept. The road out of St. Asaph descends
a steep hill, requiring caution, and a run of about
three miles along a level road, with a sharp turning
to the right over a bridge, leads to</p>

<p class="location">RHUDDLAN CASTLE</p>

<p>The entrance to the Vale of Clwyd is one of the
chief strategic points in Wales, and the elevated
knob upon which the castle stands has, from the
most remote antiquity, been a place of strength.
The early Welsh fortress had additions early in the
tenth century; it was taken by the nephew of the
Earl of Chester in 1098, and enlarged about sixty
years afterwards. The Welsh, however, captured
it from the English in 1167, and Llewelyn subsequently
held it; but Edward I. gained possession,
and built the whole castle anew in 1277
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
upon an adjacent site. The enormous walls, impressively
grand in their massive proportions, are
his work. The castle appears to have remained
in an efficient condition to the time of the Civil
War, when it was held by the Royalists; but
General Mytton captured it in 1646, and not long
afterwards it was dismantled. As one stands on
the site, one endeavours to visualize some of the
many scenes of desperate warfare which have
happened upon and around this bold sandstone
bluff, and the cattle standing knee-deep in the
translucent waters of the Clwyd, and lazily brushing
aside the clouds of flies, seem strangely out of
harmony with the memory of the wild hordes that
have dashed against these frowning walls. Within
its easily traced fosse, and enclosing a large area, there
was formerly a priory of Dominicans, which has
now disappeared, but relics of it are preserved in
Rhuddlan Church. From the grassy strath within
the walls the level plain reaching to Rhyl is spread
out very distinctly, and if the eye is allowed to
wander to Morfa Rhuddlan, which lies like a great
alluvial marsh within the triangle of Rhyl, Abergele,
and Rhuddlan, the most desolate stretch in Cambria,
the site of that great battle in 795 is seen, when
Offa, the great king of Mercia, defeated the hordes
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
of Caradoc, the king of North Wales, with terrific
slaughter. There probably exists no more pathetic
wail&mdash;the death-sob of a great nation&mdash;than that
of 'Morfa Rhuddlan,' which, next to the 'Men of
Harlech,' is the most sung of Welsh airs.</p>

<p>The road to Rhyl is gained by passing through
the village and taking the first road to the left. This
takes one directly to the esplanade opposite the pier,
where the Belvoir, a comfortable hotel, stands in a
convenient position.</p>

<p class="location">RHYL</p>

<p>Rhyl is essentially a watering-place, a watering-place
pure and simple, and it does not pretend to
be anything else. Its bathing facilities are magnificent,
its sands are excellent for a gallop, and the
<i>beau idéal</i> of parents with families, who fear that
their offspring may meet disaster unless a smooth
sweep of sand is available. It is healthy, bracing,
peaceful, an excellent 'brain-emptier'&mdash;and that
means much to the jaded man. He may be
exasperated by the pier entrance, which can only
be termed doubly debased Scottish architecture,
but architecture by the sea is seldom free from
glaring faults. As a jumping-off ground for the
Vale of the Clwyd, and for the sea-gate of Wales
at Abergele, it is convenient both by road and rail.

</div>

<p>For the first part of this section of the route the
road is retraced through Rhuddlan, and here, if the
traveller be interested in a grand example of modern
ecclesiastical architecture, Bodelwyddan Church
may be visited. It lies two miles from Rhuddlan,
to the right of the road; was erected by Lady
Willoughby de Broke; cost £60,000; and is called
the 'Marble Church,' from the whiteness of the
local limestone of which it is built. The spire and
exterior are extremely pleasing, while the richness
of the interior, with its marbles, wood-carving,
stained glass, and excess of structural adornments,
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
make it well worth a visit. A good road leads
back to the trunk route.</p>

<p class="location">THE CEFN CAVES,</p>

<p>reached by a side-road about two and a half miles
from Trefnant. These lie in the grounds of Cefn
Hall, and are <i>open on Tuesday and Friday afternoons</i>.
They are deep cavities in the limestone
rock, at one time inhabited by primeval man,
whose bones and many interesting relics of his
existence have been found by careful excavation
of the floors. A very fine view of the Vale of
the Clwyd, which has been rather overpraised, is
obtained at this spot.</p>

<a href="images/i-090l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p class="location">DENBIGH</p>

<p>In Denbigh a long, broad street leads up to the
centre of the town, and here the chief attraction,
the castle, may be visited. Passing up through
a Norman gateway, which once formed part of the
boundary of the ancient town, and was called
Burgess's Tower, the ruins of the long-abandoned
parish church, or garrison church of St. Hilary, are
seen on the spacious castle green. The old parish
church of the town is at <span class="wider">Whitchurch</span>, on the road
to Ruthin. The stately ruins of the great Norman
fortress, which kept watch and ward over this
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
portion of the Vale of the Clwyd for so many
centuries, crowns the summit of this conical hill,
and is perched nearly 500 feet above sea-level.
Long before the Norman invasion this vantage-point
had been seized upon for
a stronghold, but the great epoch
for Denbigh happened when
Edward I. sat down in Rhuddlan
and gathered into his conquering
hands the fair lands of
Wales, consolidating his power by building a castle
in each. Denbigh and Ruthin, ruled by the Laceys
and the Greys respectively, formed the nuclei of
two counties. Here Henry Percy, in the wars
with Glendower, tried to stem the tide of insurrection;
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>
and later, in the Wars of the Roses,
it was a centre of that desolation and destruction
which overwhelmed the valley under Jasper
Tudor and the Earl of
Pembroke, and reduced
it to a land of smouldering
embers. But one of
the most stirring episodes
in the history of the castle
was the grand defence
made by Colonel William
Salusbury, the stout old
Royalist, who, in the summer
of 1646, valiantly
held the walls against the
Parliamentarians. From
April until November it
was assaulted in vain, for
Salusbury had sworn that
he would not surrender
it except at the bidding
of his King. This was
eventually obtained, and the garrison marched out
with, if possible, more than the honours of war.
Soon afterwards the castle was completely dismantled,
and now chiefly serves as a place of
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>
assembly for the townspeople, a recreation-ground,
and a coign of vantage, under favourable circumstances,
for a splendid view over the Vale.</p>

<p>The road to Ruthin leads out of the busy market-place,
and a mile beyond the town one reaches the
fine old church of <span class="wider">Whitchurch</span>, now only used for
burial services. It belongs to the Perpendicular
period, and in it parts of the rood-screen may be
seen, converted into a reredos, and a screen at the
west end of the north aisle. An interesting brass
to Richard Myddelton, who died 1575, is preserved
here; he was the Governor of Denbigh Castle, and
is represented with his wife and a small family of
sixteen. The Myddeltons, like the Salusburys,
have left indelible traces upon this part of Wales,
and of the sons represented on the brass, one
became a Lord Mayor of London, and another,
the sixth, is perhaps the best known to Englishmen,
as he was the celebrated Sir Hugh Myddelton
who brought the New River to the metropolis.
The ancestral home of this family, Chirk Castle,
will be visited <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>After another one and a half miles, <span class="wider">Llanrhaiadr
Church</span> is seen, whose interior is interesting on
account of the 'Jesse' window, of fine fifteenth-century
glass, purchased with the offerings of
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>
pilgrims to the holy well in the wooded glen
above the church. It is in a remarkably good
state of preservation, with the colours rich and
brilliant. Outside the east window are the graves
of five soldiers who fell in the famous siege of
Denbigh; under one lies Captain Wynne, of the
great house of Gwydir, near Llanrwst. He died
from wounds in the castle, and by mutual
arrangement the cortège was permitted to pass
through the lines of the beleaguers, the Parliamentarians
firing the last salute over the grave
of the hero.</p>

<p>Between Llanrhaiadr and Ruthin the highest
points of the Clwydian Range come prominently
into view, the huge ruin on Moel Fammau, to
which reference has been made in connection with
Mold, being plainly visible.</p>

<p class="location">RUTHIN (<i>RED CASTLE</i>)</p>

<p>The road leads into the central square of the
town, from the south side of which issues Castle
Street. The modern Ruthin Castle is occupied
by Colonel W. Cornwallis West, Lord-Lieutenant
of Denbighshire, and the ruins stand in the Park.
(<i>Permission to enter may be obtained at the lodge.</i>)
The remains consist of a dungeon, a 'Beheading
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>
Tower,' an armoury, and some curious passages.
A whipping-post is also preserved. The ruins,
deep red in hue, and mantled by the rich green
of the clinging foliage, with a setting beyond
of the upper part of the Vale of the Clwyd,
form a picture rich in colour. Reginald de Grey
owned the castle shortly after its erection in 1280,
and it remained in the possession of his family
until about 1480. Owen Glendower attempted
its capture in 1400, but the Parliamentarians were
more successful, for it fell in 1646, after a siege of
three months, from which time it has been a ruin.
Sir Thomas Myddelton of Chirk became owner, and
the present possessor has inherited it from him in
the female line. The castle was partially rebuilt in
1826, and brought to its present condition in 1852.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Peter is an imposing edifice,
chiefly Perpendicular, and contains a finely
decorated roof of Henry VII.'s period, beautifully
carved in black oak and divided into 500
small panels. The old building adjacent and the
church are the remains of a Priory of White
Friars, and form a very picturesque addition; near
them are the former buildings of the Grammar
School, founded in 1574. The foundation is now
accommodated in better surroundings.
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>

<p>The natural environs of Ruthin are of great
beauty, and this part of the Clwyd Valley is
a favourite place of residence. Upon Moel Feulli
are the remains of a fortified British camp, enlarged
by the Romans, and from it and Moel Fammau
magnificent views may be obtained.</p>

<p>Leaving Ruthin, the upper part of the Vale of
the Clwyd is traversed, and the watershed between
the latter river and the Dee crossed at a height of
600 feet. After passing through the narrow Vale
of Nantclwyd, with its towering limestone rocks,
the small church of <span class="wider">Derwen</span>, lying off the road to
the right of Derwen Station, is seen. It contains
a handsome fifteenth-century screen and rood-loft,
with a time-honoured thirteenth-century cross in
the churchyard.</p>

<p class="location">CORWEN</p>

<p>is a centre for the railway system of Wales, but
possesses no special attractions, unless the mark of
Owen Glendower's dagger upon the lintel of the
south door of the church, inflicted, so it is said,
when in a pet, be deemed one, though probably
the tradition had its origin in the dagger carved on
the shaft of an eighth-century cross in the same
churchyard. The summit of the rock behind the
town, whereon stands a cairn, was the point whence
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
Glendower reviewed his troops previous to the
Battle of Shrewsbury. The short climb is rewarded
by a pleasing view.</p>

<p class="location">LLANGOLLEN</p>

<p>is reached by a part of the Telford-Holyhead road,
which is generally in magnificent condition. Pretty
views of the Dee, the Berwyn Mountains on the
right, the Llantysilio Mountains on the left, and
the Eglwyseg rocks in front, are obtained, and the
most beautiful part of the hill country of Wales,
as contrasted with the mountain scenery, is presented
to the eye. The loveliest views are those
lying round the town, rivalling in beauty, and
perhaps surpassing, any found elsewhere in Britain.
<span class="wider">The Bridge</span> is one of the "Wonders of Wales,"
dating from 1345, and <span class="wider">Plas Newydd</span>, lying about
half a mile from the bridge, the residence of the
famed ladies of Llangollen, should on no account
be missed. The romance of their lives is too
lengthy for inclusion here, but may be readily
learnt on the spot. The house is an aggregation
of carved oak within and without. No one should
visit Llangollen without ascending <span class="wider">Castell Dinas
Brân</span>, which towers to a height of 1,000 feet
above the village. The origin of the quaint ruins
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
upon the summit is lost in antiquity, but is attributed
to one of the early Princes of Powis. The
tide of war has raged scores of times round the
hoary fragments upon the crest, which look like
the eyrie of a robber baron or the fantastic
imaginings of a Doré. When the castle emerges
into the light of history we find that Griffith, the
son of Madoc, occupied it in the thirteenth century,
and that about a hundred years afterwards it fell
into ruin.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Valle Crucis Abbey: Ground Plan.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="location">VALLE CRUCIS ABBEY</p>

<p>(<i>admission 6d.</i>) lies two miles by road from Llangollen.
Founded by the above-named Griffith in
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1200, it is necessarily in the Early English
style, and dog-tooth ornamentation may be discovered
in the west end. The beautiful ruin
appeals to artist and antiquary alike, and is considered
the most picturesque in Wales. A little
way off to the north is <span class="wider">Eliseg's Pillar</span>, a most
astonishing early monument put up by Concenn
ap Cadell ap Brochmail to the memory of his great-grandfather,
Eliseg, who lived as far back as the
beginning of the seventh century. It is no longer
possible to read the Latin inscription giving these
facts, and the remarkable monument itself has
suffered much mutilation. Llangollen is a town
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>
in which a week can be spent with profit and
pleasure, so numerous are the places of interest in
the immediate neighbourhood. The fine escarpment
of the limestone rocks, the Eglwyseg, lying
above the village, are conspicuous on the left
for some distance on leaving for Ruabon through
the Vale of Llangollen, where the famed Wynnstay
Park is situated, the residence of Sir H. Watkin
Williams-Wynn, Bart. The house is not on view,
but admission to the park is freely given by application
at the lodge gates, close to the town. The
associations of the park are, however, the chief
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>
point in connection with it, for the Wynns go
back into remote antiquity, and the history of
North Wales and the members of this family are
inseparable. The pillar standing above the swiftly
rushing Dee is a cenotaph perpetuating the names
of those who fell in the Irish rebellion of '98, when
a Wynn took his company of yeomanry over the
water to help in the suppression.</p>

</div>

<p class="location">WREXHAM</p>

<p>From Ruabon to Wrexham tram-lines run by
the side of the road, but they do not cause much
inconvenience, and the road is good. The chief
object for visiting the town is to view the church,
which is one of the finest, if not <i>the</i> finest, in the
Principality, and enumerated among the "Seven
Wonders of Wales." It was erected in 1472 to
replace a former structure destroyed by fire. It is
a splendid example of Perpendicular architecture,
the tower of six stages and 135 feet in height being
probably unsurpassed, and the rich peal of ten bells
it contains are celebrated far and wide&mdash;they were
made in 1726. The church contains monuments
to the Myddelton and other families, and in the
churchyard the Elihu Yale tomb is of exceptional
interest to Americans.
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></p>

<p class="location">ELLESMERE</p>

<p>At Wrexham one turns towards the south
to Shrewsbury, and Ellesmere is the first town
calling for comment. There are many old carved
timber houses to be seen, a beautiful contrast to
the modern box-of-bricks erections which now so
frequently serve for dwellings. No trace of the
castle now remains; its site is occupied by a
bowling-green, whence a view into nine counties
is obtained. The church is chiefly of Perpendicular
architecture, and is worth visiting. The chancel
screen is of hatchet-work, and over the door may
be seen the groove in which the rood formerly
stood. The Oteley Chapel has a quaint figure,
<i>temp.</i> Edward IV., on the north-west pier, and also
an altar-tomb with recumbent figures. The mere
from which the town gained its name lies close at
hand; four other meres are in the vicinity, and
these, with other pleasant concomitants, help to
make very pretty and charming scenery for some
distance on the road to Shrewsbury. Shortly after
leaving the town the Ellesmere Canal&mdash;one of
Telford's great works&mdash;is crossed.

<p class="p2"><span class="wider">Shrewsbury.</span>&mdash;To pass through Shropshire without

Its physical features are strikingly picturesque,

together.</p>

<a href="images/i-104l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p>The town lies in a loop of the Severn, with the
castle protecting the opening. It is of red sandstone,
and dates in part from the time of Edward I. The
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
grounds are open, but the building is private. The
free library and museum, opposite the castle, occupy
the old buildings of Shrewsbury School, founded
in the reign of Edward VI. The museum contains
many 'finds' from <i>Uriconium</i>. The school now
occupies magnificent buildings south of the town.
Passing up Castle Street, the old Council House
gateway is upon the left, and soon after a turn to
the left at the post office brings one to <span class="wider">St. Mary's
Church</span>, a noble building, of which the base of the
tower and the nave are Norman, the transept Early
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
English, and the aisles Perpendicular, and other
portions late Perpendicular. The tower, with its
spire 222 feet high, is the third loftiest in the kingdom.
The general appearance of the interior is very
beautiful, and the Jesse window of fourteenth-century
glass should be especially noticed; it was
originally in the Grey Friars' monastery. The
glass as a whole excels that of any other English
parish church; the St. Bernard window, for
example, on the north side of the altar, attributed
to Albert Dürer, came from a church at Cologne.
<span class="wider">St. Alkmund's Church</span> can be seen from St.
Mary's, and passing that, and also St. Julian's
Church, the old Wyle Cop may be reached. Among
the ancient timbered houses there is one in which
Henry VII. stayed prior to Bosworth in 1485.
Passing over the English Bridge, the <span class="wider">Abbey
Church</span> is reached, with its imposing west front and
great Perpendicular window, and the tower, the base
of which is Norman, rising from the west end of the
nave. Internally the latter possesses three massive
Norman bays, and two of the Early English period,
a fine arch in the latter style dividing it from the
tower. The chancel and clerestory have been
rebuilt recently in good taste. There are some
interesting monumental effigies; one in the south
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
aisle is supposed to represent
the founder,
Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury,
died 1094. In
this church, then the
Chapel of the Monastery
of the Holy Cross,
Richard II. held the
'great Parliament' in
1377.</p>

<p>Returning to the
town, the road by
Beeches Lane will lead
by way of the old walls
to Murivance Tower,
the only one remaining
of the twenty which
once guarded the town.
A short distance farther
on, the 'Quarry,' with
its beautiful avenues of
lime-trees by the river,
is reached, one of the
spots of which Shrewsbury
is justly proud.</p>

<p>Having safely negotiated
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
the dangerous hill in Shrewsbury, the road
to Oswestry is easily found, and, as nothing of
supreme importance is encountered before that
town appears, the beauties of the Holyhead Road
may be appreciated.</p>

<p class="location">OSWESTRY</p>

<p>The Church possesses a remarkably fine tower,
which presents a venerable appearance by reason
of the growth of vegetation upon it. A portion
was pulled down during the Civil War, and
rebuilt some time after the Restoration. The
interior should be visited, although there are no
special features upon which to dilate. About a
mile to the north of the town lies Old Oswestry,
a very fine and well-preserved earthwork, consisting
of three concentric circles of defences. A portion
of Wat's Dyke lies adjacent. This was the first
ditch made by Offa, King of Mercia, in the eighth
century to prevent Welsh incursions; the second,
called Offa's Dyke, was dug a few miles nearer
the Welsh border, and generally parallel to the
first.</p>

<p>A stiff rise in the road announces that <span class="wider">Chirk</span> is
at hand, and the celebrated castle is the first point
of interest.
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></p>

<p class="location">CHIRK CASTLE,</p>

<p>anciently, Castel-y-Waen, is the only example of
the thirty great fortalices in Shropshire erected to
control the Welsh border which remains in complete
repair and is occupied at the present time.
It is indelibly associated with the Myddeltons, an
ancient Denbigh family who have been identified
with every popular movement in that part of the
country for centuries past. The present owner is
Mr. Richard Myddelton.</p>

<p>
(<i>The Castle is open Mondays and Tuesdays 2 to 5 p.m.,
1s. each person; other days special orders, Estate Office, Chirk,
5s. for three persons.</i>)</p>

<p>The builder of the existing fortress was Roger
Mortimer, Lord of Chirk, who in 1310 commenced
work upon the site of Castell Crogen,
which dated from 1011. In 1595 it came into
the possession of Sir Thomas Myddelton, subsequently
Lord Mayor of London. Sir Hugh
Myddelton, of New River fame, was his brother.
The Royalists seized the castle in the absence of
the second Sir Thomas Myddelton, a Parliamentarian,
who had the pleasant experience of battering
his own property in the endeavour to
retake it. Becoming disgusted with Parliamentarian
excesses, he became Royalist again, and
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
was besieged. So much damage was done by the
artillery of Cromwell that £30,000 were spent
subsequently on repairs.</p>

<p>It is a quadrangular structure, with embattled
walls, four towers of great strength at the angles,
and another defending the gateway. A court of
considerable area occupies the centre. Some very
interesting pictures form part of the treasures of
the house, and among them is the exquisite cabinet
given to Sir Thomas by Charles II. The exterior
aspect is extremely pleasing, with ivy-covered walls
and red-grey stonework forming a background to
the old-world gardens. Traces of Offa's Dyke
occur near the farmhouse at the foot of the castle.
The beautiful Ceriog Valley is an attractive feature
of this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The road to Llangollen from Chirk commands a
fine view of the vale, and a sight of one of the most
striking features of the Dee Valley, the great
aqueduct conveying the canal across it at a height
of 120 feet above the river. An iron trough in the
stonework contains the water. There are nineteen
arches, and the length is over 1,000 feet. It is one
of Telford's masterpieces.</p>

<p>Leaving Corwen, the river is passed by a bridge,
and a glimpse afforded up the Vale of Edeyrnion
to the left, at the end of which lies Bala Lake
and the source of the Dee. There are many
glimpses of charming scenery and nestling homesteads
to be seen between Corwen and Cerrig-y-Druidon,
although the latter lies upon a somewhat
bare tableland perched nearly 1,000 feet above
sea-level. The British camp of Pen-y-Gaer lies to
the right of it. Pentre Voelas is situated at the
beginning of the long descent into Bettws, and this
part of the road commands as beautiful scenery as
one could wish to see. A little more than four
miles beyond Pentre Voelas is a turning on the
left to Penmachno, and a few yards farther on the
Conway Falls are seen at the bottom of a deep
ravine. The celebrated Fairy Glen may be reached
by means of a broad green path, which leaves the
main road at the same place as that leading to the
Conway Falls. The wicket-gate, beyond which
the glen is reached, is nearly three-quarters of a
mile down this track. The beauty of the glen
is so conspicuously appealing that it has won for
itself an almost world-wide renown. The road
from this point descends rapidly, crosses the
Waterloo Bridge, and enters Bettws-y-Coed.
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></p>

<p class="location">BETTWS Y COED.</p>

<p>The charm of this delightful
locality is felt
by everyone who comes
within its influence. From
the village itself not a
mountain is visible, but
all around are beautiful
glades and the profuse
richness of vegetation
flourishing in subtle, harmonious
accord with rocks
and dashing waters. The
Miner's Bridge lies about
a mile along the Capel
Curig Road, with the
Swallow Falls a mile
farther. To Capel Garmon
a footpath ascends, and
also a zigzag road. It
affords a magnificent
panoramic view of the
chief heights of the Snowdonian
Range, with the
exception of Snowdon
itself, which is hidden by
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
the grand mass of Moel Siabod. An interesting
cromlech lies near Capel Garmon.</p>

<p>Resuming the journey, the road to Llanrwst
passes over the Waterloo Bridge and turns sharply
to the left. Llyn-y-Parc is seen across the Conway,
lying at the base of spurs projecting from the
mountains beyond, and Gwydir Castle appears at
the farther end of it.</p>

<p class="location">LLANRWST</p>

<p>This ancient market town contains a church
dating from the fifteenth century, when it replaced
a much older one. It contains several interesting
monuments and an elaborate screen. The beautiful
Gwydir Chapel was designed by Inigo Jones; it
dates from 1633, and contains five brasses of
members of the Wynne family. The large stone
coffin of Llewellyn the Great, son-in-law of King
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
John, is preserved here, having been removed from
Conway Abbey. The effigy in armour represents
Howel Coetmore, who led a hundred Denbighshire
men at Poitiers.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Gwydir Castle</span> was built in 1555, and partly
rebuilt in 1816. In the absence of the family
(Lord Carrington is the owner) it is possible that
the interesting interior may be seen. The park contains
much natural beauty, one conspicuous feature
being the lofty Falcon Rock behind the house.
Llanrwst Bridge, built by Inigo Jones in 1636, is
said to tremble if sudden pressure be placed on
one of the parapets.</p>

<p>Two miles out of Llanrwst the village of
<span class="wider">Trefriew</span> is seen across the river, a summer
resort and inland watering-place. Presently the
site of Maenan Abbey, which disappeared at the
Reformation, is passed, before reaching Maenan
House. The mountains lying between the Conway
Valley and Nant Ffrancon now present a fine
spectacle. Shortly after Tal-y-Cafn a dangerous
hill is encountered, and from its summit the
Roman station of <i>Canovium</i>, situated near Caerhun
on the Carnarvonshire side, may be discerned.
As the fishing at this part of the estuary is noted,
some coracles may perhaps be seen. The road
between Glan Conway and Llandudno reveals
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
grand views of Conway Castle and Mountain, and
all the varied scenery which makes the estuary so
famous.</p>

<p class="location">LLANDUDNO</p>

<p>The 'Biarritz of Britain' is not an inappropriate
name for this favoured town, which possesses every
advantage of splendid climate, beautiful scenery,
and perfect bathing.</p>

<p>Great Orme's Head is generally the object of
the first excursion. In the early morning it looks
very imposing, with the exquisite effect of moving
mist lying upon the placid waters of the bay at its
base, and the summit of the great limestone mass
reddened by the hues of the rising sun. It may
be seen from the carriage-road which circles it, and
affords splendid views of mountain and sea, probably
unsurpassed in the kingdom; but the best way is
to ascend to the summit by a well-marked road
north of the town leading from Church Street, and
to visit St. Tudno's Church, with its quaint entrance,
4½ feet in height, of rugged stones, and its general
aspect of antiquity. The church is seen from
Telegraph Point, which dominates the peninsula.
A cromlech lies to the left of the road leading to
it, and the remains of a stone circle are above the
church. There is plenty of rough scrambling to
be obtained.
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></p>

<p>The carriage-drive is best entered near the pier
(<i>motors one shilling toll; pedestrians one penny</i>).
The way rises and falls like the Corniche Road;
red rocks alternate with white or grey limestone;
at times the track is at a giddy height, and
presently near the surface of the water. The view
up the Menai Straits, with the coasts of Anglesey
and Carnarvon nearing each other at the bridges, is
very fine, but when the farthest point of the headland
is reached, that which leads back to the town
is no less beautiful, affording as it does one of the
finest prospects of the noble outline of the Carnarvonshire
Mountains.</p>

<p>The visitor should not fail to visit the Little
Orme, where the sheer cliffs and grassy summit
often offer a seclusion much appreciated after the
boisterous exuberances of an August crowd. There
are many coigns of vantage around Llandudno
from which the appreciative traveller can gaze over
mountain, sea, and strath, and also a number of
interesting edifices that may be visited if sufficient
time is allowed.</p>

<p>Unlike Aberystwyth, there is a considerable
choice of hotels at Llandudno. The Queen's is
recommended for its fine position on the front and
for its general excellence.

<a href="images/i-120l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p>The road into Conway leads over the suspension
bridge built by Telford, the harmony of the towers
with the adjacent castle being a subject of general
congratulation. The entrance to <span class="wider">the Castle</span> (<i>admission
3d.</i>) is close to the end of the bridge. The
structure possesses the characteristics of Edwardian
castles, with more ornamentation than usual, and was
undoubtedly, when perfect, one of the most magnificent
fortresses in the kingdom. It commands, as
usual, one of the roads through the passes leading
from Wales&mdash;that from the Snowdon district and
Anglesey. The chief points of interest are the
Queen's Tower, with its oratory, the Great Hall,
the King's Tower, and the Broken Tower. It is a
matter for surprise that so much remains of interest
in the castle to the present day, which, like nearly
all the castles in Wales, was dismantled by the
Parliamentarians. The soft grey colour of the
stone, and the warm, rich greens and browns of
the foliage which creeps over them, is exceptionally
pleasing; the delightful views of the surrounding
country, and the wonderful position occupied by
the massive walls, all conduce to render Conway
Castle a conspicuous landmark in the recollection
of the traveller.</p>

<p>In passing down Castle Street, a late Perpendicular
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>
carved stone on the front of a house on the
south side is of interest, and so also is a quaint
building, now a temperance hall, dating from the
year 1400.</p>

<p>One of the entrances <span class="wider">to the Church</span> lies in this
street. The building is of the Decorated period,
and is of great interest, as it contains a Perpendicular
rood-loft, richly carved, with priests' entrance
in perfect preservation, and a fine screen; a lace
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>
humeral and corporal 400 years old, preserved
behind glass in the vestry; and a curious post-Reformation
arched tomb on the south side of the
chancel.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Walls</span> of Conway are unique, and form
the best example in Europe of thirteenth-century
scientific fortification. The Saracenic influence
engendered by the Crusades is strongly exemplified
in their construction; they are one mile in circuit,
about 12 feet thick, with four gates and many
semicircular towers. The feature of piercing the
merlons of the battlements for the discharge of
arrows is exemplified here, as in the castle. This
undulating, encircling wall, clothed with creepers
in parts, and presenting picturesque features at
every turn, is a dream of medievalism not often
encountered. Upon the quay stands the reputed
smallest house in Great Britain, squeezed into a
corner of the fortifications; one can stand in the
road and shake hands with a person in the upper
story.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Plas Mawr</span>, or Queen Elizabeth's Palace
(<i>admission 6d.</i>), dates from 1585, and has its
chief frontage in Crown Lane. It is a perfectly
preserved example of the architecture of that
period, and abounds in archæological objects of
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
interest. The 365 windows and 52 doors are not
merely a coincidence.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Leaving Conway, the <span class="wider">Sychnant Pass</span> may be
traversed if desired; it is a steep road leading over
the mountains to Penmaenmawr, revealing fine
views over the whole district.</p>

<p>The main road leads round the coast via Penmaenbach
Point, near Conway Mountain (upon
which are traces of an ancient fort). At <span class="wider">Penmaenmawr</span>
one finds a cluster of modern villas, of every
size and design, nestling at the foot of an enormous
mass of stone towering up to a height of 1,550 feet&mdash;the
well-known Penmaenmawr Mountain. Upon
the summit, which affords a magnificent view for
many miles round, are the ruins of one of the
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>
strongest of the early British forts, said to have
accommodated 20,000 men. It is a matter for
infinite regret that this important link with
primitive Wales should be doomed to disappear
through the steady advance of the huge quarries
now eating into the hill. These quarries, and
the steep tramway-lines up to them, also very
seriously detract from the beauty of the spot.
After leaving the village, the great round hump
upon the summit of the mountain can be plainly
seen from the road.</p>

<p>At <span class="wider">Llanfairfechan</span>, a small seaside resort, one
reaches a typical Welsh resort&mdash;bathing-machines
and sands combined with incipient mountain-climbing.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Falls at Aber</span> are two miles from the
road, and can only be reached by footpath. The
effect of the falls varies greatly with the season;
but the climb up the valley towards Foel Fras is
very fine. The road now passes inland somewhat,
and the views of the Straits, of Beaumaris, and
of Puffin Island, hitherto enjoyed, become obscured
by trees. Near Bangor one of the entrances to the
park surrounding Penrhyn Castle is seen upon the
right, and here is the Model Village of Llandegai,
interesting to those engaged in the social problems
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>
of the day. Workmen on the Penrhyn estate are
housed in pretty cottages grouped in twos or threes,
and placed in gardens. Avenues of trees shade the
village roads, in the middle of which is Llandegai
Church (<i>the key generally hangs up in the porch</i>).
A tomb with two recumbent effigies of interest
lies within: it came from Llanfaes Priory, but whom
it represents is not known; the armour of the
knight and the costume of the lady point to
<i>c.</i> 1470. The church is charmingly clean and
well kept. In the village no public-house is allowed,
a state of things which has been productive of the
very best results.</p>

<p>The road runs some distance by the park, and
at times affords a view of <span class="wider">Penrhyn Castle</span>, the
entrance to which is seen upon taking a sharp turn
to the right, when Penrhyn Port is perceived; the
bridge leads up to the gateway. (<i>Open Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons, 10 to 5; 2s. for one
person; 1s. extra for each additional one. Half
the proceeds goes to local hospitals.</i>) The castle is
an impressive modern reproduction of a Norman
fortress; the keep reminds one of Rochester, and is
really fine. The interior is worth a visit, if only to
see how Lord Penrhyn has adapted modern luxury
to the rough Norman architecture.
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></p>

<p class="location">BANGOR</p>

<p>Upon leaving the castle, University College is
passed upon the right, and a drive through the
street leads to an open triangular space, where the
cathedral comes into sight. Although the cathedral
site has a rich history, having been occupied by the
first church about 525, yet the present edifice is
singularly uninteresting and unimpressive. This is
undoubtedly due to the fact that the Saxon church
was destroyed in 1071, the Norman successor in
1211, and the Early English building in 1407,
when it was reduced to ruins, and remained so for
nearly a century. Consequently, the main part of
the present edifice only dates from Henry VII.'s
reign, and the tower from 1532. There is nothing
of interest in the cathedral and but little outside.
The clock, however, upon the occasion of the
writer's recent visit, was worth noting, as the
hands, the striking parts, and Greenwich time,
were all at variance. Thus, when the hands
pointed to 9.54, Greenwich time was 9.49, and
the clock struck 10.</p>

<p>From the road leading downwards by the cathedral
there is a view of the new University buildings,
placed upon a commanding site overlooking the
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>
town. Lower Bangor lies in an amphitheatre of
hills, upon which Upper Bangor is being built, the
latter embracing the fashionable part of the town,
and also the goal of pleasure-seekers, who patronize
the sands and the pier.

</div>

<p>Those who wish to see Wales in all its aspects
should on no account miss the twenty-mile run
from Bangor to Bettws. It has been termed the
most impressive pass in North Wales, and poetically
referred to as 'Beauty sleeping in the lap of Horror.'
To fully grasp the feeling of the place a walk
through it on a mild winter's day is desirable, and
on January 1 of last year one of the writers experienced
that sensation, when flying scud and wild
lashing torrents of occasional rain from whirling
masses of black clouds upon the sombre peaks added
a realistic force to the wildness of the scene.</p>

<p>The road leading to Penrhyn Castle and Llandegai
is that which should be taken. At Bethesda
a typical slate-quarrying town is reached, with
great 'tips' of refuse encircling it; the continual
roar and rattle of engines, dragging tramloads of
slate, high above the roadway, is punctuated with
the occasional boom of the blastings. The quarries
may be visited if desired, when a memorable sight
will be witnessed.
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></p>

<p>There is nothing in this centre of Welsh Nonconformity
of antiquarian interest, and soon a steady
ascent leads from it into the Nant Ffrancon Pass,
presumably the Valley of Beavers. Upon the right
lies a range of mountains, each over 3,000 feet in
height, and well known to climbers&mdash;Elidyr Fawr,
Y Garn, and Glyder Fawr, with Glyder Fach
straight in front, and the giant mass of Moel
Siabod behind it. On the left, Carnedd Llewelyn,
3,484 feet, and Carnedd Dafydd, 3,426 feet, send
down great shoulders into the pass, where the
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>
winding road, ever ascending, climbs above the
grassy valley lying between the encircling giants.
At Benglog Bridge, where the foaming Afon
Ogwen leaps down the boulders in a torrent, one
is nearly 1,000 feet above sea-level. Here the
lonely Llyn Ogwen comes into view, but before
passing it the short clamber over rocks to Llyn
Idwal should on no account be omitted. The path
begins behind the little inn, and winds by the side
of the stream draining from the lake which abruptly
comes into view. This lonely tarn, with its waters
reflecting the black scarp of Glyder Fawr, seldom
or never lit up by the sun's rays, and often lashed
into foam by the fierce eddies sweeping down from
the mountains, is the very embodiment of awe-inspiring
impressiveness. Even if the day be
beautiful there is a wild loneliness, which is accentuated
by the legend of Prince Idwal being brutally
murdered here by Dunawt at the instigation of
his father, to whom the youth had been entrusted
by his parents.</p>

<p>The terrific black chasm seen in the rocks overshadowing
the pool is named <span class="wider">Twll Du</span>, or <span class="wider">the
Black Cleft</span>, but popularly 'The Devil's Kitchen.'
It is 450 feet high and 100 feet deep, narrowing
in places to 6 feet wide. A foaming cataract of
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>
troubled waters pours down, forming in its fall
the hollows at the base termed 'The Devil's Pots.'
Many fatal accidents to climbers have occurred
here in ascending to Llyn Bochlwyd, lying nearly
700 feet higher, on Glyder Fach, last year (1910)
being by no means immune.</p>

<p>South of Lake Ogwen, <span class="wider">Tryfaen</span>, the three-headed
mountain, is remarkably impressive. Soon
after the lake is passed a descent commences to
Capel Curig, where a magnificent view of the
eastern slopes of Snowdon is obtained between
Moel Siabod and Glyder Fawr. The combined
waters of the Llugwy and Nant-y-Gwryd accompany
the road as it leads downwards to Bettws-y-Coed,
with the Swallow Falls and Miners' Bridge,
as previously noticed (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>).

<p class="p2">The road from Bangor leads past the <span class="wider">Menai
Suspension Bridge</span> over the Straits, once a
wonder of the world, but now overshadowed by
the Forth Bridge and others. It was opened in
1826. The total length of the roadway is 1,000 feet,
which is suspended over the water at a height of
100 feet above the highest spring-tide. The view
from the bridge is most picturesque, but it is
hardly worth while to take a car over. (<i>Motor-car
2s. toll; foot passengers 1d. each.</i>) The bridge has
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>
a very distinct swing in a high wind. Farther on
one sees the <span class="wider">Britannia Tubular Bridge</span>, opened
in 1850, and carrying the railway across in two
hollow tubes of enormous strength. No one can
accuse this engineering feat of being beautiful,
but it has thoroughly proved its efficiency. The
Anglesey Column forms a prominent landmark at
the farther end of the bridge; it was erected as a
memorial of the Marquis of Anglesey who distinguished
himself at Waterloo. The well-known
Plas Newydd, the residence of the present peer,
lies adjacent, and there also is the village of
<span class="wider">Llanfair</span>, sometimes Llanfair Pwll Gwyngyll,
and a full name of fifty-four letters if one is still
more respectful. At Port Dinorwic vessels load
up with slates from Bethesda. The view of the
Anglesey coast is fine at first, but the shores
gradually deteriorate as one reaches Carnarvon,
eventually spreading out in mud flats.</p>

<p class="location">CARNARVON</p>

<p>As the great Roman town and fortress of
<i>Segontium</i>, the reputed birthplace of Constantine
the Great, the site of a famous feudal fortress,
and the birthplace of the first Prince of Wales,
Carnarvon undoubtedly occupies a unique position
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
in British history, and, as it still possesses tangible
evidences of most of its past record, the traveller is
unwise who passes by without a stay of at least a
few hours' duration, though a few days would be
more appropriate.

</ul>

</div>

<p>Behind the Royal Hotel, which is passed on
entering the town, is a small rocky knob, easily
climbed, called Twt Hill, a coign of vantage for
viewing the Carnarvon mountains, the Straits,
Anglesey, and Carnarvon itself. On a clear day
the mountains of Wicklow can be seen, and as a
practical exponent of the ichnography of the town
the hill is of great use. The approach to the
castle by a narrow road suddenly reveals a view of
<span class="wider">Carnarvon Castle</span>, the vast dimensions of which
may probably be best gleaned by walking down to
the slate wharf on the River Seoint, laving the
walls. Here the great height of the walls, the
quality of the excellent stonework, and the general
effect of impregnability, are realized. Returning to
the main entrance, the great arch known as the
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
<span class="wider">Queen's Doorway</span> is passed high up in the wall; it
is the traditional spot whence the infant Edward
was shown to the Welsh chieftains by his father.
The drawbridge at one time crossed the street at
this point; an inn now occupies the sight of the
barbican. Within the castle (<i>admission 4d.</i>) the
visitor is at once struck with the idea that a
medieval fortress in its entirety is presented to the
view; there are no crumbling ruins or ivy-clad
masses of fallen masonry, as in the majority of
structures of this nature. This is accounted for by
the fact that it belongs to the Crown, and every
stone as it becomes weathered is carefully replaced.
The castle is, in fact, a most interesting study for
the archæologist, as illustrating medieval methods
of defence. The Eagle Tower, the reputed apartment
where Edward II. was born, the Queen's
Gateway, and other interesting parts, are pointed
out by the keeper. It should be remembered that
the castle is the finest in Europe except one; that
it was built by Edward I. in 1283, heightened by
Edward II., garrisoned by the Royalists in the
Civil War under Lord Byron, and after an able
defence surrendered to the Parliamentarians, who
ordered its demolition in 1660, which was fortunately
not carried out. <span class="wider">The Town Walls</span> of
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
Carnarvon are interesting objects to the visitor,
as is also St. Mary's Church, built into the walls,
a tower forming the vestry and the walls two sides
of the church.</p>

<p>Of <i>Segontium</i>, the great Roman station, but
little remains. A portion of the wall, in bad
condition, lies in a narrow lane at the top of the
hill, gained by ascending Pool Street and Tithebarn
Street and passing round to the right, at the back
of the Rectory, before reaching Llanbeblig Church.
There are other and better sections to be seen by
making inquiries. In one instance, in the front-garden
of a house, it is some 20 feet in height,
formed of beautifully squared stones, and can be
seen from the roadway; by the courtesy of the
occupiers it is quite possible for a nearer view to
be obtained. This wall undoubtedly extended to
the river.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The road to <span class="wider">Llanberis</span> leads from Castle
Square up Pool Street for a short distance, when
Llanberis Road is entered. The route is to a certain
extent spoilt at first by intrusive chimneys and
other industrial manifestations. Llyn Padarn has
also been ruined by quarries, and probably was never
celebrated for scenery. The peak of Snowdon is
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>
seen intermittently
upon
the right, but
the chief
mountain features
are Elidyr
Fawr (the
other side of
which has been
seen from
Nant Ffrancon)
and Carnedd
Dafydd,
3,426 feet.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Llanberis</span>
is a favourite
tourists' resort
for fishing and
mountain-climbing,
and
a headquarters
for excursions
to neighbouring
points.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Dolbadarn
Castle</span> is of
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
remote antiquity, and probably existed in the sixth
century, its position making it a fortress of importance.
It has probably seen as much wild work as
any castle in Wales, especially during the Glendower
period, being the master-key to the Snowdon
region.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Old Llanberis</span>, beyond Llyn Peris, is more
picturesque than the new, and contains a church,
which is chiefly interesting on account of the graves
in the churchyard of those who have lost their lives
on Snowdon. The entrance to the famous <span class="wider">Pass of
Llanberis</span>,
between
Glyder Fawr
and Snowdon,
is very
impressive,
and the narrowness
of
the valley
gives it a distinct
character
compared
with
Nant Ffrancon.
It is
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
probably the finest mountain defile traversed by
a carriage-road in the Principality. A huge
mass of rock, which in falling has produced a
natural cromlech, is to be seen on the left. The
summit of Glyder Fawr appears before the end of
the pass is reached, but that of Snowdon is still
hidden. The highest point of the pass is 1,179 feet
above sea-level. The views obtained upon reaching
Pen-y-Gwryd are a relief after the wildness of the
route traversed. Moel Siabod to the left front,
with the sugar-loaf height of Cynicht, are prominent
features, while the view down the Gwynant Valley
is one of the sweetest prospects in Wales. At the
hotel occurs an abrupt turning to the right, and a
sharp descent leads to Llyn Gwynant, a picturesque
lake, from which a grand view of the rugged slopes
of Snowdon is obtained. Llyn-y-Ddinas, farther on,
is scarcely less pleasing. Soon afterwards</p>

<p class="location">BEDDGELERT</p>

<p>is entered, the most romantically situated village in
Wales, standing at the junction of three valleys,
leading respectively to Carnarvon, Portmadoc, and
Capel Curig, and surrounded by a grand array of
mountain peaks. It derives its name from the
story of Llewellyn's hound, and means 'the grave
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
of Gelert.' The rude monument said to have been
erected by the Prince in his repentance for the
hasty act may be reached in a few hundred yards
from the village. Moel Habog, 2,566 feet, is an easy
climb from here. The road to Penrhyn Deudraeth
leads through the romantic Pass of Aberglaslyn,
and emerges upon the far-famed bridge, where the
rich colouring of the rocks, full of exquisite contrasts
with the foliage, delights the eye at every
glance. There are many parts of Switzerland that
afford similar visions of beauty and grandeur, but
what Pont Aberglaslyn loses in size it gains in the
beauty of its colour. The junction of two roads
occurs here&mdash;one to Tremadoc, the other to Penrhyn.
The latter drops to an extensive and dreary
plain, Traeth Mawr, across which the road winds
with many a sharp turn. The views of the
distant mountains are very effective, while straight
in front the Castle of Harlech becomes a prominent
feature, with the waters of Cardigan Bay to right
and left.</p>

<p class="caption">DISTANT VIEW OF PENMAENMAWR.<br />

</div>

<p><span class="wider">Penrhyn Deudraeth</span> is a mining village of no
interest, except as the starting-point of the Ffestiniog
narrow-gauge railway. Here the river draining the
Vale of Ffestiniog enters a large sheet of water
called Traeth Bach, and, crossing it by a bridge, the
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>
Morfa Harlech, an uninteresting flat, is entered,
with the modern Castle of Deudraeth to the right.
Here the road runs between the Morfa and the high
country to the left, until it reaches the little town of</p>

<p class="location">HARLECH</p>

<p>Unless the visitor should happen to be a golfer
and a frequenter of the famous St. David's Club
Links, there is practically nothing of interest in the
neighbourhood except the castle, famous in history
and song, which occupies a precipitous elevation in
the front of the town. The entry is opposite the
Castle Hotel. (<i>Admission 4d.</i>) A fortress of some
sort existed as early as the third century, when
Bronwen, or White-Bosomed, the daughter of
Bran the Blessed, lived here. About 550 a more
substantial pile was raised, but this in turn was
replaced by the present castle, built by Edward I.
in 1280, who, however, incorporated much of the
older building in his new fortress. In 1404 it was
seized by Glendower, but retaken by the King's
troops in 1408. Margaret of Anjou took refuge in
it after Northampton in 1460. Edward IV., after
a long siege, captured it in 1468, and the 'March
of the Men of Harlech' dates from that period.
During the Civil War the castle was alternately in
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>
possession of both parties. It is now Crown property.
The magnificent view from the battlements should
be seen. Across the bay, seven miles, is the sister
castle of Criccieth, while the long promontory
of Carnarvon, termed Lleyn, forms a bold feature
on the north-western horizon. The two highest
elevations on the promontory are The Rivals, and
Bardsey Island is the detached fragment. To the
right there is a line of mountain peaks to Moel
Hebod and the Snowdon heights. Two and a half
miles to the south of Harlech the Island of Mochras
lies off the shore, joined at low tide by an isthmus.
It is chiefly visited for its beautiful shells. Near it
is the commencement of the Sarn Badrig, a curious
ledge of rocks, bare at low tide, which runs far out
into the waters of the bay. A similar formation,
though of less extent, lies off Aberystwyth. To
the antiquary the country to the east of Harlech
is of the greatest interest; it teems with relics,
chiefly prehistoric, such as cromlechs, stone circles,
and dolmens. The far-famed Roman Steps, the
Lake of Cwm Bychan, with its abnormally savage
surroundings, the Drws Ardudwy, all lie in this
interesting hinterland, mostly far away from the
main road. Near Llanbedr, however, between the
road and the river, and just short of the village, are
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
two long stones, and another bearing an Ogham
inscription. <span class="wider">Llanddwywe Church</span> is not of any
particular interest, but two cromlechs stand nearly
opposite the King's Head Inn, about eighty yards
from the road. The large cromlech known as Arthur's
Quoit is at some distance, near Cors-y-Gedol, the
old seat of the Vaughans, or Vychans, of Cors-y-Gedol.
The church at <span class="wider">Llanaber</span> is of Early
English architecture, and should be visited. An
inscribed stone of much interest and with various
decipherings stands near the north-west door; it
was found below low-water mark on the beach near
the church.</p>

<p class="location">BARMOUTH</p>

<p>This rather overbuilt watering-place is situated
in a romantic position at the mouth of the
Mawddach, and is remarkable for its genial winter
climate, the town being protected by the high hills
surrounding it. Apart from the visitors who crowd
into the town during the summer season, there
are a great number who utilize it as a centre for
mountaineering, antiquarian, geological, and fishing
excursions. The houses are built up the face of
the cliff, so that the chimney-pots of one house are
opposite the front-door of the house behind, and it
is possible to diagnose a neighbour's dinner by the
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>
odours thus conveyed. The church is new, but
some interesting geological contortions occur near
it. The view from the railway bridge is one of
the most remarkable in Wales. (<i>The toll is 2d.,
and one of the best times for seeing the estuary
and its mountainous setting is at sunset.</i>) High
tide helps the scene enormously. A rich and
sombre purple, partly clothing the mountains, melts
into exquisite gradations of green and velvety
browns. Cader Idris, upon the right, fills all that
side of the picture; the Arrans furnish the centre
distance; while the outliers of Llawr Lech and
Y Garn occupy the left. A well-known projection
on the flanks of Cader is the Giant's Nose.</p>

<p>The Panorama Walk is a favourite stroll from
Barmouth; it is commenced at a terrace bearing the
curious name of Porkington, and direction-boards
indicate the route. The path truly deserves the
name it has been given, although the labelling of
scenery in this way is exceedingly distasteful.</p>

<p class="location">THE ESTUARY OF THE MAWDDACH</p>

<p>The road to Dolgelley lies upon the northern
shore of this famous estuary, and for beauty and
impressiveness cannot easily be overpraised. The
many windings in the road accentuate its charm,
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>
glimpses, sometimes of entrancing beauty, being
frequently presented to the traveller. Besides the
scenery there are no special objects to be indicated
upon the road; just beyond Brintirion, however, a
stream descends which has passed through the gold-field
of St. David's, lying upon the slopes of the
mountain above. The ruins of <span class="wider">Cymmer Abbey</span>,
near Llanelltyd, remind one forcibly of Valle
Crucis Abbey, so charming and reposeful are the
surroundings. It was founded <i>c.</i> 1200 by the
Cistercians, and dissolved at the Reformation.
The adjoining farmhouse contains parts of the
refectory and abbot's lodging. The eastern portion
of the church is in the best preservation, and upon
the south are a few Early English arches and
pillars. The road here turns sharply to the right
to Dolgelley, and, entering this quaintly-situated
little town, the Golden Lion Hotel is found in the
market-place near the church.

</div>

<p>The road from Dolgelley passes, with many windings,
from the town to the estuary at Penmaenpool,
to which place excursion steamers run during the
summer from Barmouth. Although the scenery
upon the south bank of the Mawddach is not so
fine as that upon the north, yet the mountains of
Ardudwy, as the hinterland of Barmouth was
anciently called, present an imposing aspect, and
sometimes compose a pretty picture when seen
through the umbrageous foliage which lines the
road on both sides. If the tide be high, the view
is accentuated by the reflections in the broad
expanse of water, and singularly beautiful glimpses
are at times displayed. The undulating road,
flanked at times by the universal whitewashed
cottages, reaches <span class="wider">Arthog</span>, a small village situated
at the base of a finely wooded, diversified ground,
about a mile from which are the Arthog Lakes,
and at a short distance from the hotel a waterfall,
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
of considerable beauty after a heavy fall of rain,
but much attenuated in dry weather. At Friog
the slate quarries are apparent on the left of the
road, and a steady rise begins, leading to an
excellent retrospective view of Barmouth, Harlech
Castle, and the Lleyn Peninsula to Bardsey.</p>

<p class="caption">SNOWDON FROM TRAETH MAWR.</p>
</div>

<p class="location">LLWYNGWRIL</p>

<p>is a small village, with the Dyffryn River passing
through it under a bridge. Castell-y-Gaer lies
upon its banks at a short distance up the stream,
consisting of small masses of broken ivy-clad
masonry, of an unknown fortress so far as history is
concerned. Upon the bridge before mentioned
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
on Sunday evenings after church or chapel the
youths and maidens of the village congregate to
sing the sweet Welsh refrains handed down through
long generations, and harmonized with a beauty
of feeling which only a music-loving nation can
express. Among the men singularly rich basses
prevail; north of Barmouth, strange to say, tenors
predominate. The route turns abruptly inland
beyond Llangelynin, and the village of</p>

<p class="location">LLANEGRYN,</p>

<p>lying off the main road, but approached by a lane,
appears on the left. It contains a church well
worth visiting, inasmuch as the superb rood-screen
is among the finest in the British Isles. It is of
early Perpendicular work, and the loft above is
quite perfect except for the actual rood and the
figures of saints. A good roof and an interesting
Norman font should also be noticed.</p>

<p class="location">THE BIRD ROCK</p>

<p>may be seen from this point, an isolated crag of
peculiar shape standing up black and dour against
the mountains beyond. The weird beauty of the
landscape can hardly be overpraised. The road
leading straight onwards passes almost underneath
the rock, but the main route to the right descends
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
to the bridge over the river, draining the Dysynni
Valley, and Tal-y-llyn. Here are some sharp
turns, but presently the very narrow road is
reached, leading directly to the lake. Passing
another vehicle is not an easy matter. The
scenery increases in beauty as one progresses,
the little railway to the right having scarcely the
smallest deteriorating effect upon the valley. The
ruins of Castell-y-Bere, formerly one of the largest
in Wales, and once visited by Edward I., lie in the
adjacent valley to the left, to which the narrow
road leads, coming into Abergynolwyn on the left.</p>

<p class="location">TAL-Y-LLYN</p>

<p>Tal-y-llyn is a quarter of a mile in width,
and a little over a mile in length. It lies under
Cader Idris, although the summit is not visible
from it; two great craters, however, carved in its
rocky flanks, form a fitting background on the left.
In front lies a valley, by ascending which the <span class="wider">Cross
Foxes Inn</span> is reached, and subsequently Dolgelley.
Extravagant praise has been lavished upon the
lake by many travellers, but one misses some
essentials to claims of exceptional beauty. No
quality of mystery appeals to the imagination;
the lake does not lie in an appalling neighbourhood
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
of black riven rocks or in a glen of surpassing
beauty. All is open, and the whole is
seen at one vision. Anglers, however, find Tal-y-llyn
an ideal spot. At the farther end of the lake
the road, after a branch track to the right by a
cottage has been passed, turns to the right up a
steep ascent, from whose summit a retrospective
view of the lake is perhaps the best obtainable.
The road to Corris through Nant Gwgan is pretty,
with occasional waterfalls and stone slides from the
shoulders of mountains towering hundreds of feet
above the pass. The rich browns and greens and
subtler shades of grey form charming contrasts of
colour. Unfortunately, the lower end of the pass
is disfigured by many slate quarries. Upper Corris
is strongly reminiscent of Bethesda. A monument
is erected here on the left side of the road to
Alfred W. Hughes, F.R.C.S., who died in 1900 of
fever during the war in South Africa. A quarry
railway, with a miniature station and a gauge of
2 feet 3 inches, runs by the side of the road. At
Corris, which is a slate-mining town pure and
simple, the road trends to the right, and the view
becomes less circumscribed as the vale of Afon
Dulas widens out. When the Dovey Valley is
reached a wide expanse of alluvial land comes into
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>
view, through which the river meanders westwards
towards its estuary.</p>

<p class="location">MACHYNLLETH</p>

<p>Machynlleth is a spacious and well-built market
town and borough with two main streets, wide and
pleasant, with well-kept shops, thus forming a
marked contrast in that respect to the majority
of Welsh towns. It forms one of the centres of
the woollen industry of the county, and indulges
somewhat in the tanning business as well. The
clock-tower is a prominent object; the church
has no features of interest worth recording; the
Market-house dates only from 1783, and of antiquarian
curiosities there are but few. An old
black-and-white cottage at the end of Maengwyn
Street, which branches off to the left at the chief
main street, has '<span class="smcap">OWEN PUGH O VXOR 1628</span>' for
'Owen Pugh and wife.' The '<span class="smcap">O</span>,' however, is
baffling as a conjunction. Opposite are portions of
the old Senate-house, the reputed building in which
Owen Glendower succeeded in persuading the
nobles and commons to acknowledge him Prince
of Wales in 1402. Upon the hills surrounding
Machynlleth remains occur which appear to indicate
that the town was a Roman station, and coins
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>
have occasionally been found to confirm this. A
good road up the Valley of the Dovey leads to
Cemmaes, where the trunk route is again reached.</p>

<p>The road down the Valley of the Dovey presents
a pretty panorama, but possesses no particular
feature to arrest attention&mdash;it is merely a pleasant
drive.</p>

<p class="location">GLANDOVEY</p>

<p>This small place stands at the entrance to the
Lyfnant Valley, one of the most distractingly
beautiful little glens in the whole of Wales, with
waterfalls, torrents, and utter wildness of vegetation,
and stern, bleak splendour at the farther
end, where Pistyll-y-Llyn showers its two foaming
torrents headlong into the black caldron beneath.
The first cataract met, the Glaspwll Cascade, is
a fine one, but it cannot vie with the more remote
example. There is a prettily situated small castle
on the left of the road. The estuary of the Dovey
now appears, and if the tide be at the flood, presents
a very fine prospect. Aberdovey generally has a
brig or two lying off the quay. An extensive salt
marsh now comes into view, between which and
the high land the road runs. <span class="wider">Borth</span> lies on the
coast of this plain; its hydro, links, and beautiful
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
sands attract visitors during the summer. At
Tre-Taliesin we are reminded of the grave of
Taliesin, the 'King of the Bards' during the
sixth century; the pilgrimage to his grave, which
lies about a mile to the left of the road, is a
favourite one from Aberystwyth. Two miles
farther on the remains of a British camp or fort
crown the summit of Moel-y-Gaer, close to the
road upon the right; they are remarkably well
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
preserved, and in the neighbourhood are some
Druidical circles. In this district the open
country around is quite park-like in many places;
at times, however, it reminds one of parts of
Devonshire. About two miles from Aberystwyth
there is a beautiful vista of Cardigan Bay and the
coast laved by its waters, with the town lying
below at the termination of a long and rather
trying hill.</p>

<p class="location">ABERYSTWYTH</p>

<p>Aberystwyth not only boasts of a high antiquity,
but also of having been the commercial centre for
the Mid-Welsh counties. The trade has now
dwindled, but as a watering-place it easily holds
its own as one of the most frequented in Wales.
The chief points of interest are:</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span>, the ruins of which occupy a position
of prominence in the centre of the town, was built
by Gilbert de Strongbow in the reign of Henry I.
It was destroyed by Owen Gwynedd, and rebuilt
by Edward I.; in the Civil War it was dismantled
by the Parliamentarians. The grounds are now
laid out in pleasant walks, affording fine views of
the coast.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The University Buildings</span> adjoin the castle,
and may be termed one of the finest examples
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
of recent architecture in the Principality. The
general effect of the modern buildings in the town
is depressing, probably owing to the use of the
dark Silurian stone, covered with the universal
slate roof.</p>

<p>The town is happy in having an immediate
neighbourhood of great interest to the antiquary
and to the ordinary tourist, inasmuch as many
pleasant excursions may be indulged in, such, for
example, as the visits to Strata Florida Abbey,
the Monk's Cave, Lyfnant Valley, and the Devil's
Bridge.</p>

<p>The route to Llangurig commences in Aberystwyth,
in Northgate Street, and runs through Llanbadarn.
At Pont Erwydd a road leads south to
the Devil's Bridge, fifteen miles, a feature which
should not on any account be missed.</p>

<p>An alternative route, eleven and three-quarter
miles to the bridge, is a part of the direct road to
Rhayader.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="wider">First Route, the Pont Erwydd.</span>&mdash;Road
level for first six miles, then rise to 1,027 feet; hilly.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Llanbadarn.</span>&mdash;Church much restored.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Bangor</span> to <span class="wider">Goginan</span>.&mdash;Lead-mines have destroyed
scenery. A wild country around Pont
Erwydd, where the route turns to the right.
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="wider">Alternative Route.</span>&mdash;The direct road to
Devil's Bridge commences in Bridge Street,
crosses the harbour, and passes under the railway.</p>

<p>About five miles out Cader Idris appears, twenty
miles away to the left. The view afterwards into
the Rheidol Valley is very fine. The highest point
of the road, 989 feet above sea-level, commands
a fine view of the two peaks of Plynlimmon.
Castell-fan-Crach is a prehistoric earthwork.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Devil's Bridge</span> is situated in what is
probably the finest and most picturesque glen in
the British Isles; the approach to it by either of
the roads described gives only a slight idea of its
merits. The monks of Strata Florida Abbey are
supposed to have built the arch in the time of
Rufus; the second bridge dates from 1814. The
Devil's Punch Bowl, the Robbers' Cave, and the
Falls of the Rheidol, should be seen.</p>

<p>The road to Llangurig from Pont Erwydd leads
through a bare valley containing a large number of
abandoned lead-mines&mdash;the dead hopes of thousands
of sanguine speculators. The highest point of the
road, 1,368 feet, is only two and a half miles from
the summit of Plynlimmon (2,469 feet high), about
two miles from the source of the Wye, and four
miles from that of the Severn. The mountain
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
is dull and uninteresting, being more of a flat
spreading lump than a peak, and has extensive
tracts of bog-land and marsh. Descending towards
Llangurig, the Wye is crossed near an inn, and
accompanies the road down the valley, which is
cultivated to a certain extent in its lower portion.
At Llangurig the main route is reached between
Llanidloes and Rhayader.</p>

<a href="images/i-171l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p class="location p2">DOLGELLEY,</p>

<p>the capital town of Merionethshire, is situated in
a wide and fertile valley of singular beauty at the
foot of Cader Idris. The streets are exceptionally
short and irregular. The parish church of St. Mary
has no particular merits; in it is preserved a fourteenth-century
effigy of one of the Vaughans, or
Vychans, of Nannau. From Dolgelley various excursions
may be made to such places of rare beauty
as the <span class="wider">Precipice Walk</span>, cut high up on the face
of Moel Cynwch, with views over the Gaullwyd
Valley. <span class="wider">The Torrent Walk</span> is beautified by the
rich greens and browns lavished by Nature on the
rocks by the foaming torrent of the Clywedog.
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
Three fine waterfalls
are also to
be found in the
neighbourhood,
one the well-known
Pistyll-y-Cain,
while
the ascent of
Cader from this
town is a very
desirable one.</p>

<p>The road from
Dolgelley to
Dinas Mawddwy
is an interesting
one,
both by reason
of the stiff climbs
and also the
fine views that
accompany it.
The surface is
generally inclined
to be
rough, and upon
the occasion of
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
the writer's recent visit the portion leading down
into Dolgelley was appallingly bad. No doubt
this state of things does not exist now. At
the <span class="wider">Cross Foxes Inn</span> the road turns sharply
to the left and mounts to <span class="wider">Cold Door Pass</span>,
situated upon a bleak moor, with a splendid view
of Cader Idris standing in grand isolation and
beauty. Many mountains suffer by the proximity
of other heights, but Cader is an exception. From
the pass the road gradually descends through a
valley, increasing in beauty of verdure and foliage,
to Dinas Mawddwy.</p>

<p class="location">DINAS MAWDDWY</p>

<p>This sequestered little town lies in a deep hollow
formed by the junction of two valleys, which discharge
the streams they respectively contain into
the Dovey, occupying the main valley. The town
consists of one long street, with the grounds and
house of Plas at the termination. The church is
chiefly known for its enormous yews, one in
particular being of really vast dimensions. Dinas
Mawddwy is a centre for anglers, sportsmen,
and artists, and, during the season, for excursionists.
From the road a waterfall is a prominent
feature.
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></p>

<p>The road from Dinas Mawddwy follows the
course of the Dovey, and lies in a valley of singular
beauty; although the mountains on either side
seldom approach 1,500 feet, yet they possess a
beauty of form which seems characteristic of the
district, and are, as a rule, well wooded.</p>

<p class="location">CEMMAES</p>

<p>is a fairly large village lying off the main road, and
nestling for shelter under an outlying crag of the
mountains to the west. Shortly after, at Cemmaes
Road, the route turns sharply to the left (by going
straight on one approaches Machynlleth), and looking
backwards a fine array of familiar peaks are
seen up the broad valley just traversed. The road
to Caersws is at first very winding, with occasional
sharp dips; pleasant glimpses are obtained into
well-wooded glens, where tributaries of the river
flow over their troubled course to join the Afon
Garno, or Carno, and before reaching Carno an
extraordinary stratification of the rocks is revealed,
chiefly in the railway cutting. A natural arch of
anticlinal stratification occurs at Talerddig, with
every appearance of being built of masonry. At
Carno the valley becomes open and pastoral.
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></p>

<p class="location">CAERSWS</p>

<p>stands at the confluence of the River Carno and
the Severn, and was a place of considerable importance
in the Roman period. Their influence is still
seen in the straight piece of road just traversed,
and in other sections still to be passed. In the
centre of the village the winter camp is seen, a
rampart about 150 yards square, with the road
cutting across the centre. The vallum and accompanying
fosse are at some points well preserved.
Several summer camps occupy the surrounding
heights, and many traces of the great Roman road
going east and west are to be discovered. At
Moat Lane Junction, which lies at a short distance
to the left of the route, is a rectangular earthen
fort, with a moat adjacent surrounding a high
mound, now covered with firs. At <span class="wider">Llandinam</span> a
statue to a certain David Davies stands prominently
by the roadside. The Severn Valley here is
wide and open, with many plantations of firs; the
railway runs close beside the river for miles. In
the distance upon the right may be seen the rounded
summits of Plynlimmon, often dark and sombre
against the sky.
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></p>

<p class="location">LLANIDLOES</p>

<p>This is a typical Welsh market town, extremely
uninteresting and remarkably dull, with the depressing
style of architecture so characteristic of
the majority of houses in the Principality. Externally
dreary, too, are the places of worship,
and one longs for a board of architects and artists
who will supervise new building plans and save
the land from further ugliness, so conspicuous
where Nature is so full of artistry. The town is
devoted to the Welsh flannel industry, and is well
known to climbers as the jumping-off point for
the ascent of Plynlimmon, about ten miles to the
west as the crow flies. In the deeply furrowed
shoulders of this mountain are the birthplaces of
two famous rivers, the Wye and the Severn.
About two miles north of the town are the Van
Lead Mines, once so important; and upon Van
Hill, close to them, occurs a large hill-fort, of
which so many are scattered about this district.</p>

<p>The Market-house is of wood, and decidedly
quaint; the church possesses a ceiling of carved
oak, reputed to have been transported from the
suppressed Abbey of Cwm Hir, in Radnorshire; it
stands near the bridge, and is dedicated to St. Idloes.
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
From this point a rather pretty view is obtained of
the Severn uniting with a tributary, the Clywedog.</p>

<p>The five miles between Llanidloes and Llangurig
present occasionally landscapes reminding
one forcibly of English pastorals, if the mountains
can possibly be kept out of sight. The village of
<span class="wider">Llangurig</span> possesses a small church of no very
great interest; perhaps the chief fact connected
with the place is that the village is the highest in
Wales, for it stands at an elevation of nearly
1,000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>

and dale, with various streams crossing the road at

<p class="location">BRECON</p>

<p>Brecon, the county town of Brecknockshire, lies
upon the River Usk, and was formerly defended
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>
by walls and gates. Of the castle, destroyed as
usual during the Civil War, only a few fragments
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
near the Castle Hotel have survived, and one
restored section facing the river.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Mary's Church</span> has suffered so much from
bad restoration that practically nothing of archæological
interest remains in it.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Priory Church.</span>&mdash;This building is only
excelled in Wales by the Cathedrals of St. David's
and Llandaff. It is a massive cruciform structure,
with a central tower, high roof and gables, and an
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>
external aspect almost devoid of ornamentation.
The eastern portions are of Early English work,
and the nave was gradually transformed during
the fourteenth century into a Decorated building,
with great octagonal piers, broad arches, and a lofty
clerestory. The carved Norman font should be
noticed, and also a number of effigies, one dating
from 1359. An interesting feature are the chapels
on either side of the presbytery, called respectively
the Chapel of the Normans and the Chapel of the
Men of Battle, the priory being a cell of Battle
Abbey. The guilds of the town had chapels in
the nave, those of the tailors, weavers, tuckers,
and courvisors, or shoemakers, being at the west
end. The domestic buildings still remain, and
are attached to the southern side of the west end
of the nave; the building has been restored by Sir
Gilbert Scott. The town is a pleasant one by
reason of the many public walks in and about it,
and fine views may be obtained of the well-known
Beacons, some of them approaching 3,000 feet in
height.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The district round Brecon abounds in prehistoric
camps and various remains of the British, Roman,
and Saxon occupations. On the road to Llandovery,
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
for instance, near Llanspyddyd, there is
a Roman fort, and another of unknown origin
adjoining, with a Roman road passing round them.
Senny Bridge merely consists of a long street of
uninteresting houses. At <span class="wider">Trecastle</span> there is an
important mound, at one time crowned with a
fortalice. From the centre of this village there
is a steep ascent. The River Usk accompanies
the road, and appears under various surroundings&mdash;now
as a placid stream winding through meadowlands,
and again as a foaming torrent in a deep,
tree-shaded glen. This road through the outliers
of the Beacons abounds in picturesque views of a
well-wooded country, backed by the great swarthy
slopes of the hills, called the Black Mountains,
although the dark brown sandstone of which they
are composed is the same colour as the brown heath
upon them.</p>

<p class="location">LLANDOVERY</p>

<p>Llandovery consists chiefly of two streets, which
converge at the market-place, and a welcome change
is the red wash with which many of the houses are
covered, as a relief from the ubiquitous whitewash
of the rest of Wales.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle.</span>&mdash;This has nearly disappeared, and
only two dismantled circular towers, with a curtain
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>
wall between, remain. They may be found standing
on a grassy knoll near the Castle Hotel. The River
Bran is fairly wide at this point, and passes under
a fine bridge.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Llandovery a level crossing has to
be negotiated; the road crosses the River Towy,
and then turns sharply to the left.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Llanwrda</span> is a pretty village situated amid
lovely pastoral scenery, and with a fine prospect
over the valley. The road here turns at right
angles towards the north, and between this point
and the Hafod Bridge Inn, nearly four miles, the
scenery is distinctly and strikingly beautiful. The
small stream, the Dulais, accompanies the route,
passing and repassing under the road. Near
Pumpsaint lies a gold-mine, the Ogofan, and here
the River Cothi, beloved of piscators, comes down
from the mountains on its way to the Towy.
Between Pumpsaint and Lampeter high ground
is crossed, and a portion of the Sarn Helen Roman
road appears near an inn beyond Pont-ar-Twch.
Near Lampeter a village occurs bearing the ominous
name of Rain.</p>

<p class="location">LAMPETER</p>

<p>is one of the best-known fishing centres in Wales,
the River Teifi affording exceedingly good sport.
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
It is a well-built town, situated in a fertile
valley. The bridge over the stream is said to have
been erected in the time of King Stephen, from
which the town claims the name of Lampeter
Pont Stephen. The chief building is St. David's
College, theological, designed for those who cannot
afford Oxford or Cambridge. To gain the road
for Newcastle Emlyn and Cardigan the river at
Lampeter must be recrossed, and the turning taken
to the right at 'Gwar Gate' Inn. The route
gives a striking view over the valley of the Teifi,
whose extraordinary meanderings and loopings
appear as a huge serpent of silver lying in the
broad landscape. The road for a considerable distance
is of Roman construction&mdash;the Sarn Helen,
but even those conquerors of the world could not
conquer Nature in Wales and make their roads
straight.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Llanbyther</span> is a small and prettily-situated
village, with one of the numerous 'Pen-y-Gaer'
camps lying close to the road. The New Quay
Road Station of Llanfihangel-ar-Arth turns off to
the right soon after the Aber-Iar Inn; it is of
a second-class character, but saves a considerable
distance and some hills on the way to Llandyssil.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Llandyssil</span> is a romantically-situated village
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
upon the banks of the Teifi, which here assume
a rocky character. Its church is dedicated to
St. Tyssul, who lived in the early part of the sixth
century. From Llandyssil the road south of the
river should be taken to Newcastle Emlyn; it has
many awkward turns.</p>

<p class="location">NEWCASTLE EMLYN</p>

<p>is a well-situated town with a long street running
at right angles to the coach-road.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> is a beautifully-placed ruin, with
grand views over the surrounding country. The
position of the fortress for natural defence is most
remarkable, for the Teifi here forms a reversed S,
and in one of the loops so made the ruins are
situated, the moat thus naturally formed being
one of the most remarkable in existence. The
most ancient building upon the site is reputed to
have had a Roman origin; the second was erected
by Sir Rhys ap Thomas (who built Dynevor
Castle) in the time of Henry VII., who frequently
resided here, and from it the town was termed
'New-castle.' The Royalists held it throughout
the Civil War, but after that period it appears to
have lapsed into ruin. Two octagonal towers supporting
an arch give entrance to the ruins.
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>Three miles out from Newcastle Emlyn is
<span class="wider">Cenarth</span>, a most picturesque and pleasantly-situated
little village upon the border between
Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. There is a
fine salmon-leap close to the hamlet which is worth
seeing. The road thence to Cardigan traverses a
plain, becoming more and more open as the town
is approached, presenting a broad sweep of smiling
woods and pasture.</p>

<p class="location">CARDIGAN</p>

<p>The chief centre of interest in Cardigan is undoubtedly
the bridge over the Teifi. It probably
dates from the Early English Period, and has been
widened. From this point there is a good view up
and down the river, with the castle and church as
prominent features.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle.</span>&mdash;The small portion hidden away
in the ivy at the present time affords no clue to
the former size and importance of this stronghold.
It was founded in the time of Henry II. by the
Prince of South Wales, and after a chequered
career was dismantled at the Commonwealth. The
keep is now occupied by private houses.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> (<i>key obtained at one of the cottages
in the road</i>).&mdash;The tower is a fine one, but so far as
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>
the whole interior is concerned it must be confessed
that all ecclesiological features of interest have been
obliterated by paint, plaster, and incongruous additions.
The chancel arch, of the Perpendicular
period, has a fearful and wonderful 'skew,' which
may or may not have been acquired by age.</p>

<p>The town contains a number of old houses,
nooks, and byways, but they are only moderately
interesting to the artist, who finds his best subjects
by the bridge and along the river, where sailing-boats
and small steamers reveal the picturesque
qualities generally to be found in small ports. One
feature of the town soon attracts attention&mdash;namely,
the strong reluctance of the majority of chimneys
in Cardigan to keep to the perpendicular.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Dogmael's Priory</span>, less than two miles
from Cardigan, lies upon the left of the estuary.
The remains are of the Early English period, and
are still considerable. Martin de Tours, who came
over with the Conqueror (not St. Martin), was the
founder.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Kilgerran Castle</span>, three miles south of the
town, and easily reached by road, stands upon a
vast bare rock uplifted above the foaming, eddying
stream rushing round its base, through a narrow
channel in the rocks. Many eulogistic statements
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
have been made concerning this beauty-spot, but
none have overpraised it. The ruins consist of two
towers, with part of a gateway and curtain wall,
together with fragments of massive bastions. It
was erected about 1223, when Marshall, Earl of
Chepstow, subdued the Welsh in these districts.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p><span class="wider">On leaving for Newport</span>, the long rise of the
road affords, in about two miles, a remarkably fine
view towards the left. With Mynydd Prescelly
for a background, the composition of the foreground
and middle distance by a beautiful vale is
singularly impressive, and this view, with panoramic
changes, accompanies the road to Nevern.</p>

<p>The hills seen in the front have massive rocky
crags penetrating their otherwise smooth outline.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Nevern.</span>&mdash;A very dangerous turn in the road
ushers the traveller into this beautiful little village,
embowered in the midst of rich meadows, orchards,
and gardens in a situation which is eminently
picturesque and pleasing. The River Nevern flows
through the village, and an amphitheatre of well-wooded
hills encloses it.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> consists of some slight remains of
a Norman building, apparently of a square plan,
with bastions at the angles.
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> is one of the largest in the county,
and of very great interest. It is of Early English
architecture, with a Perpendicular recess forming
a chapel upon the south side. In the window-sill
of the south window of this chapel is inserted a
long granite stone, with an Ogham inscription
upon it, together with a slab bearing an excellent
example of an early interlaced cross. The church
stands in a quite ideal sloping churchyard, containing
a stone cross about 13 feet in height, with
Celtic ornamentation and two inscriptions, not yet
satisfactorily deciphered, as far as the writer is
aware. Near the south porch is a menhir with an
inscription.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Pentre Evan</span> cromlech, one of the finest
known, lies about three miles from Nevern by road,
but less than two as the crow flies. A car may be
taken by a third-class road for the greater part of
the distance, but a local guide is necessary.</p>

<p class="location">NEWPORT</p>

<p>Newport is a small fishing town, and also a seaport,
upon the estuary of the Nevern. It is a quiet
watering-place, the sea-bathing being very good,
while the surrounding country is of enticing interest.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> was built in 1215, and used by
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
the lords of Cemmaes for their courts. It was
destroyed by Llewelyn, but restored recently by
a descendant of the first baron, but in such strong
contrast to the original Norman architecture that
it is very disappointing externally.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> has been built near the castle, and
partakes somewhat of its character, being stern and
massive in its proportions. The interior contains
nothing of particular interest.</p>

<p>A small cromlech lies within a few hundred
yards of the centre of the town, to which any
inhabitant will direct one. Occasional glimpses of
the estuary, with its sands gleaming in the sun, are
obtained from the main streets of the town.</p>

<p>The road between Newport and Fishguard
reveals a wide view of the Prescelly Mountains,
the highest in Pembrokeshire, and a favourite
climb for visitors. A most attractive view of
Goodwick Harbour, now generally known as Fishguard,
is obtained from the road, or, better still,
from one of the steep meadows on either hand.
The great importance of this harbour in connection
with the Atlantic mail and passenger service has
suddenly brought a remote district into prominence.
It is now a familiar sight for the natives to see a
huge liner in this natural harbour take on
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
passengers and cargo, while a few years ago the
waters of the deep inlet had never been churned
by propellers.</p>

<p>The descent into Fishguard of 1 in 7 must be
taken with extreme caution; at the foot of the
curving descent a bridge crosses the Afon Gwaen,
and from this the road climbs with equal suddenness
and at an equally trying angle. It is a hill
calculated to test to the last fraction of its horsepower
the capacity a car possesses in hill-climbing.
At the top of the ascent the whole bay is spread
out in panoramic fashion, and one can see the
new breakwater, still incomplete, protecting the
anchorage.</p>

<p>The road from Fishguard to St. David's passes
first across the isthmus of the Pen Caer Peninsula,
whose northern part terminates in Strumble Head.
This district is the happy hunting-ground for the
archæologist, as it literally teems with prehistoric
remains&mdash;castles, camps, stone circles, cromlechs,
and menhirs, are encountered almost at every
step. Two miles out of Fishguard the turning to
the right should be taken at a puzzling junction of
roads. At Mathry some cromlechs occur near the
road, and two miles farther on a wayside cross may
be seen. The hills in this neighbourhood generally
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
have the formation noticed previously at Cardigan&mdash;namely
the projection of high tors from their
summits, breaking through otherwise smooth elevations.
Nearing St. David's Head it is obvious that
the face of the landscape is gradually changing:
the hedgerows become less in height, and are often
mere mounds of turf or stone; the few trees met
with are dwarfed and attenuated, and invariably
lean away from the south-west. As St. David's
comes nearer these characteristics become accentuated,
and a barren, wind-swept moorland appears,
almost unrelieved by a single tree.</p>

</div>

<p class="location">ST. DAVID'S</p>

<p>The modern town of St. David's has a sad
and desolate air, arising from the number of
abandoned houses to be seen on every hand.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Cathedral</span> (<i>nave open free on weekdays,
9 to 1 and 2 to 6; a charge of 6d. is made
for admission to the eastern chapels</i>) is in a remarkable
situation at the farther end of the town, and
practically bursts upon the view when the edge
of the deep hollow it occupies is reached. In such
an exposed corner of Britain it is not surprising
that everything should take what shelter it can
find, but to walk through a rather dreary and
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
wind-swept Welsh village, and to <i>discover</i> a magnificent
cathedral cowering almost out of sight
at one's very feet, is not an everyday occurrence
even with the touring motorist. A score of
abbeys planted in sequestered valleys will come to
the mind of anyone who has explored this island,
but a well-preserved cathedral built in a deep and
narrow hollow in a rocky promontory almost takes
away what little breath the blustering wind has
left to the exploring stranger. To the left is the
old tower gateway, a weather-worn remnant of the
embattled fortifications which once encircled the
monastery. Down below, and approached by a
long and steep flight of stone steps, stands the
church, with the square tower of rather unsatisfactory
outline dominating the nave, transept, and
eastern portions of the buildings. Beyond appears
one of the most beautiful ruins that ever gladdened
the eye&mdash;the remains of one of the finest episcopal
palaces to be seen in the British Isles. Near the
church are also grouped ruins of the conventual
buildings, and the whole forms a scene that
indelibly impresses itself upon the memory.
Descending the thirty-nine steps, one reaches the
south porch of the nave. Whatever preconceived
ideas one may hold of the beauty of this part of
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
the church, the sight of the original far surpasses
them. The beautiful Norman pillars and graceful
arches, ornamented with the most elaborate chevron
and zigzag mouldings of the Transitional period;
the clerestory springing directly from the dwarfed
triforium with which it is incorporated; and the
whole surmounted by a finely-wrought timber
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
roof, make a picture of the rarest perfection. The
colouring is full of subtle richness, the stonework
being of a soft dove-grey combined with a bluish
tinge. The building dates from 1180, the previous
church having been burnt down by pirates. The
tower fell in 1220, and was rebuilt at different
periods. The choir and transepts are Early
English, but were added to in the Decorated
period. The eastern chapels are Decorated, as
is also the beautiful rood-screen. The ceiling in
the nave dates from <i>c.</i> 1500. Many objects of
interest are contained in the building; the shrines
of St. David and St. Caradoc, the tomb of Edmund
Tudor, father of Henry VII., the monument of
Bishop Gower, the chapel of St. Thomas à Becket,
and the fan tracery of the roof in Bishop Vaughan's
Chapel, are all worthy of careful inspection. Outside
the north wall of the nave gigantic and ill-proportioned
buttresses are seen, built in 1248 to
strengthen the nave, which had suffered from an
earthquake; on the opposite side are the remains
of the cloisters of St. Mary's College, begun in
1362.</p>

<p>The exploration of the ruins of the Bishop's
Palace should on no account be omitted, as the
lower chambers, the row of clerestory arches, the
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
beautiful doorways, and the general composition
of the whole ruin, are worthy of the closest
attention.</p>

<p>Upon the return to the main street the ancient
cross is seen, no less than 28 feet in height; the
steps were restored by Bishop Thirlwall in 1873.</p>

<p>The coast scenery at St. David's is remarkably
wild, and the subjects for the painter in oils or
water-colours, or for the less ambitious who carry
a sketch-book and a good soft pencil, are full of
particular attractiveness. To those who are without
the desire or capacity to carry away any
permanent impressions of the scenery it will be
enough to lie in a sheltered spot and watch the
white waves burst into columns of spray on the
northern end of Ramsey Island.

</div>

<p>The distance from St. David's to Haverfordwest is
sixteen miles, or, as the natives naïvely express it,
'sixteen miles and seventeen hills.' For the switchback
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>
contour, however, one is compensated by the
wide views generally obtained when the tops of the
hills are reached, before plunging downwards into
the next sudden hollow. The same characteristics
of wild moorland and storm-swept down prevail as
noticed upon the road to St. David's, and it is very
interesting to note how gradually the vegetation
develops as the route progresses. About two miles
out the little village of <span class="wider">Solva</span> is passed, lying upon
a romantic inlet in this iron-bound coast, and
recalling, to some extent, the fishing village of
Staithes, in Yorkshire. The view over St. Bride's
Bay, with Skomer Island as the farthest point, is
exceedingly fine on a crisp, sunny morning, and
shortly after leaving Solva, Pointz Castle, an
earthwork, appears upon the right hand, at a short
distance from the road. The sharp descent to
<span class="wider">Newgate</span> brings one almost within reach of the
salt spray at high tide, and the road runs for a few
hundred yards by the sands of that name, giving a
glimpse of some fine coast scenery. There is an
example here of a 'rolling beach,' an accumulation
of pebbles being washed over and over upon the
flat land beyond. The road now climbs to the
uplands, upon which stands <span class="wider">Roche Castle</span>, a conspicuous
landmark for many miles. It was built
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
in the reign of Henry III., but has later windows
inserted. Garrisoned for the King during the time
of the Civil War, it was captured by the Parliamentarians,
but subsequently retaken. Lord St.
Davids, the present owner, has adapted it for
modern habitation. Its position upon a rocky
scar, in the midst of a treeless plain, is peculiarly
imposing.</p>

<p>As the road approaches Haverfordwest trees of
respectable proportions begin to appear, no longer
leaning towards the north-east.</p>

<p class="location">HAVERFORDWEST</p>

<p>The town of Haverfordwest occupies an important
position among those of South Wales, and is the
centre of commerce for a large district. The streets
are narrow and steep, with sharp turnings, probably
caused by the confinement of the ancient fortifications
which once protected the town. Of these
practically nothing remains but the shell of a
strong castle, now converted into the county gaol,
standing upon a rocky eminence overlooking the
town. Although very impressive when viewed
from a distance or from the River Cleddau in the
town, it hardly repays minute inspection. Gilbert
de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, is said to have built it
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
about 1120, and it became, with that of Pembroke,
one of the most important fortresses in 'Little
England,' as the southern part of Pembroke was
termed. It was demolished by order of Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Mary's Church</span> is of great interest, the
exterior showing some fantastic gargoyles, and the
nave some fine clustered columns of Early English
work, with a Perpendicular clerestory above. The
ceilings should be noticed, and also the early lancets
at the west end. It is a beautiful church, full of
light, with no gloomy corners. There is an ancient
wooden carving of St. Michael the Archangel and
the Dragon, dating from the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Priory Ruins</span> are situated a short distance
from the southern part of the town, and are quite
picturesque. They are the remains of a priory of
Austin Canons erected in the twelfth century.
The very liberal grants of Robert de Hwlffordd,
lord of this town, were confirmed by Edward III.
The remains of the minster are of Early English
work.</p>

<p>The road from Haverfordwest takes a sharp turn
to the right upon leaving the town, and passes over
the railway-lines. An isolated church stands upon
a hill to the right, and soon afterwards the woods
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
surrounding <span class="wider">Picton Castle</span>, two miles away, come
into view. It is one of the most ancient residences
in the kingdom, having been built by a De Picton
in the reign of Rufus. From that time it has been
inhabited by an unbroken line of proprietors, never
deserted, never vacant. The alterations have not
very much affected the baronial style of the building,
and until quite recently it presented the appearance
of a medieval fortress.</p>

<p>At Canaston Bridge the road crosses the eastern
Cleddau, which discharges into Milford Haven,
and here, upon the left, at about a mile, lies the
picturesque ruin of <span class="wider">Llawhaden Castle</span>, once a
residence of the Bishops of St. David's. The gateway,
flanked by two demi-bastions, forms a very
effective picture.</p>

<p>Approaching Narberth, the right-hand road
should be taken at Robeston Wathen. Fir-trees
near this point begin to make their appearance,
having been conspicuously absent from St. David's
to this point.</p>

<p class="location">NARBERTH</p>

<p>There is a very steep hill in this town, leading to
the ruins of a Norman castle crowning the summit.
They are picturesquely covered with ivy, but the
remains now apparent are small when compared
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
with those visible in the eighteenth century. The
roads in the neighbourhood of Narberth are rather
misleading, as so many by-roads enter. Care
should be taken to decipher the sign-boards in many
cases before proceeding. Between Narberth and
St. Clears, for instance, there are three roads at
Tavernspite near an inn, and the centre one should
be taken.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Clears</span> is a long and straggling village at
the head of an estuary of the Taff, and vessels of
small tonnage can reach it at high tide. It formerly
possessed a castle and a priory, but both have disappeared.
The town itself is uninteresting. Between
St. Clears and Carmarthen the small hamlet of Banc-y-Felin
is particularly pleasing, with a tributary of
the Taff flowing through it.</p>

<p class="location">CARMARTHEN</p>

<p>Carmarthen, the capital of the shire, stands upon
the site of the Roman <i>Maridunum</i>, and is the point
of convergence of two roads, Via Maritima and Via
Montana. Some parts of the town stand at a considerable
elevation, and present an imposing picture
from a distance. It is an excellent example of an
old Welsh town, retaining a great deal of its
primeval quaintness. Upon market-days, when it
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
swarms with people from the surrounding districts,
one seldom hears a word of English spoken, and
the busy scenes witnessed in the bustling market
are mainly transacted in the mother-tongue. Upon
entering the town the Picton Monument is seen,
raised in honour of the Peninsula hero, who fell at
Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church of St. Peter</span> is a large building
chiefly in the Perpendicular style, with a lofty
square tower. The interior has been very carefully
plastered so as to hide everything of interest.
A Roman altar, however, may be seen below the
tower.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Steele, who died in 1729, the friend
of Addison, and the well-known man of letters,
lies buried in this church. In his old age
he came to reside at Llangunnor, near Carmarthen.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span>, which at one time made Carmarthen
a place of strength, was demolished by the
Parliamentarians, and the small portion remaining
has been converted into the county gaol. On
leaving Carmarthen the route towards Llandilo
lies upon the Roman road, the Via Montana. It
includes some of the finest scenery in South Wales.
There are two roads running in the valley, with
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
the railway separating them; the north one is the
more picturesque.</p>

<p>At a loop in the road about ten miles out,
Middleton Hall, lying due south, and erected by
Sir William Paxton, may be recognized by the tall
tower which forms such a conspicuous landmark.
It is known as <span class="wider">Paxton's Tower</span>, but was raised
by him in memory of Nelson. Almost directly
afterwards, <span class="wider">Dryslwyn Castle</span> comes in sight, a
most picturesque ruin, consisting of one tower and
many fragments of walls. It was besieged in the
time of Edward I., when Lord Stafford and other
leaders lost their lives, in undermining the fortress,
by the sudden collapse of the walls beneath which
they were operating.</p>

<p>On Grongar Hill, a few hundred yards away to
the right, the poet Dyer composed his poem
'Grongar Hill.' The view from the summit is
charming. On the farther side of the valley can
be seen Golden Grove, the residence of Viscount
Emlyn. <span class="wider">Dynevor Park and Castle</span> come into
view upon the right front on reaching the neighbourhood
of Llandilo. The ruins stand upon a
lofty mound a short distance from the road, in the
most attractive portion of the park. The first
castle was built in 877, and almost rebuilt in
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
the time of William the Conqueror. For some
centuries it was the residence of the Princes of
South Wales. Henry VII. granted it to Sir Rhys
ap Thomas, a descendant of the Princes, and
ancestor of the present owner, Lord Dynevor. It
was occupied until 1760. The remains consist of
a round keep and a square tower, commanding
a magnificent prospect. (<i>The ruins are open for
inspection to the bona-fide visitor upon application.</i>)</p>

<p class="location">LLANDILO</p>

<p>Llandilo is a small town perched upon two or
three steep hills to the north of the River Towy,
crossed here by a stone bridge of one span. The
streets are narrow, with the public buildings
grouped together in the centre of the town. The
church was thoroughly rebuilt in 1848, and everything
of interest then disappeared. If a stay can
be arranged at Llandilo, one of the most remarkable
edifices in the kingdom, <span class="wider">Careg Cennen</span>, should
be seen. It is a castle almost without a history,
standing upon a rocky height with inaccessible
precipices on three sides, the foremost one over
300 feet in height. Two square towers guard the
sloping ground upon the fourth side, and the
main portion of the castle occupies the summits
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>
of the precipices. The situation is superb and
the scenery delightful. The spirit of romance
is free from any of the handicaps usually suffered
by the historian, for in this castle among the clouds,
in connection with which history is silent (except a
reputed origin in the thirteenth century at the
hands of Rhys of Wales), the wings of imagination
may soar to any height. This is a site awaiting
the novelist in search of a romantic setting for a
story of the Middle Ages. It stands about five
miles to the south-east of Llandilo, overlooking
the Vale of the Towy.</p>

<p>Between Llandilo and Llanwrda a large Roman
camp can be seen lying upon Carn Goch, and at
the inn where the road turns to Llangadock a
large tributary joins the Towy. In a few miles
Llanwrda is reached, and the loop for St. David's
is thus completed. For the road between Llanwrda
and Talgarth, see <a href="#Page_143">pp. 143-148</a>.</p>

<p>The route from Talgarth to Hay is winding,
and care should be taken to avoid the numerous
roads leading away from the main road, which lies
on the south side of the River Wye, and for a considerable
distance is parallel to the railway.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Glasbury</span>, beyond the Three Cocks, is a small
village much frequented by the fishing fraternity;
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
a fine prospect of the Black Mountains is obtained,
and the views generally are among the best to be
found in the district.</p>

<p>The entry into Hay is very pretty, with shady
hedgerows and many of the attributes of English
scenery.</p>

<p class="location">HAY</p>

<p>This little town lies upon the borders of England
and Wales, at the junction of the shires of Radnor,
Hereford, and Brecon. The word 'Hay' is allied
to 'hedge,' meaning a boundary. It was at one
time the main entry into Wales from England,
and naturally, from its position, it has seen stirring
times in the past.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> dominates the town, and is easily
reached from the main street; the entrance is at
the back. The architecture now appears to be
a mixture of all kinds, including Tudor, for
numerous additions have been made. A residence
constructed out of the old materials occupies part
of the site. Sir Philip Walwyn is supposed to
have built the first castle in 1090, and at the end
of the twelfth century extensive additions were
made. Henry III. almost rebuilt it, and in 1233
Llewelyn ap Jorweth stormed it. Thirty years
later it was taken twice, and in the time of Glendower
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>
it was burnt. Many other minor happenings
have occurred to lend variety to its existence.
James I. made large additions to the building.
The fortifying walls once enclosing the town have
nearly disappeared. The road upon the town side
traverses the former moat. A view across the
river gives a glimpse of a Roman camp near the
stream, while to the north-west stands Clyro,
reached by a main road, and enclosed by beautiful
woods. A mound of earth and a moat are now
the sole remains of the proud and lordly Clyro
Castle mentioned by Leland.</p>

<p>The ruins of Cusop Castle and Mouse Castle lie
at a short distance from the town, and a favourite
excursion is that to the far-famed <span class="wider">Llanthony</span>
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
<span class="wider">Abbey</span>, lying amid romantic wilds some ten miles
to the south.</p>

<p>The route to Whitney crosses the river at Hay,
passes through Clyro, and in two miles affords a
view of <span class="wider">Clifford Castle</span>, standing upon a bold
eminence by the side of the river; it was the
birthplace of Jane de Clifford, the Fair Rosamond
of Henry II., and the former residence of the Lords
de Clifford. The scenery in the environment of
these beautiful ruins is most charming. The route
from Hay may be taken in this direction if desired.
(<i>A toll of 9d. has to be paid to cross the river.</i>)</p>

<p class="location">WHITNEY</p>

<p>The village of Whitney is surrounded by a rich
belt of pasture-land interspersed with clumps of
trees, and exceedingly beautiful scenery is to be
found upon the river-banks. There is no ancient
church, for it was washed away in a flood in the
early part of the eighteenth century. The beautiful
views seen at Whitney unfold themselves more and
more as one reaches Letton, Merbach Hill upon
the right, rising high out of the ground like a hog's
back, giving a characteristic touch to the scenery.
At Letton a particularly beautiful group of black-and-white
timbered cottages stand by the side of
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>
the road, and remind one that English soil has
been reached, and that the never-ending monotony
of the Welsh whitewashed cottages has at last
been left behind. At <span class="wider">Staunton</span>, on the Wye, a
little Early English church is perched above the
village. On the right there formerly stood a
castle, and near it is Moccas Park, the residence
of Royalty in Saxon times. The present owners
are descended from Richard, the second son of
King John. After passing Byford a portion of
<span class="wider">Offa's Dyke</span> occurs upon the left, crossing over
Mansell Hill. Some quaintly-cut yew-trees may
be seen near the Kite's Nest Inn, and just before
entering Hereford, at White Cross, an interesting
cross is noticeable. It was put up in 1347 by
Bishop Charlton to commemorate the disappearance
of the Black Plague, and was restored by
Archdeacon Lord Saye and Sele.</p>

</div>

<p class="location">HEREFORD</p>

<p>is a pleasantly-situated town, but if it were not for
the possession of a cathedral the place would not
offer any particular attractions for visitors beyond
the charming river scenery common to the Wye
Valley.</p>

<p>Hereford became a separate see in 673, and
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
Putta was the first Bishop. The first church was
rebuilt in a better fashion when the remains of the
murdered Ethelbert were brought to Hereford,
but this pre-Norman structure was burnt by the
Welsh in 1055. In 1079 Robert of Lorraine, the
first Norman Bishop, began the cathedral of which
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
much exists at the present day, using dark red
sandstone. The choir up to the clerestory, the
arcades of the nave, and the south transept, are
Norman work of this early date.</p>

<p>The beautiful Lady Chapel, and the clerestory
of the choir are Early English. The north and
both the eastern transepts, part of tower, and the
chapter-house, are Decorated. The chantries,
sacristy, and a few other parts, are Perpendicular.
The western tower fell in 1786, and brought down
with it the west front and the first bay of the nave.
This disaster accounts for the modern west front.
Upon entering the nave the Norman bays are
singularly impressive, especially the carved capitals.
The choir is entered through a metal chancel screen;
the stalls are richly carved, and 'the chair of King
Stephen' is preserved in it. Scattered about in
the great building there are probably more
monumental tombs and effigies than in any other
cathedral, and this is especially true with regard
to ecclesiastics. Two notable monuments are
those of Bishop Aquablanca (1245-1268), and the
shrine of St. Thomas of Cantilupe in the north
transept. A famous archæological treasure, the
<i>Mappa Mundi</i>, a map of the world, drawn on one
large sheet of parchment in the thirteenth century
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
by Richard de Haldingham, is preserved in this
building, and may be seen upon application. The
Bishop's Palace is close to the Wye, on the south
side of the cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Shire Hall</span>, a Grecian Doric building,
standing in St. Peter's Square, was erected in the
early part of the last century.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle Green</span> is the site of the vanished
Castle of Hereford; it is one of the prettiest
parts of the town. Hereford contains some
interesting houses, and three of them, now used
as a bank, may be seen in the High Town. It
was at one time the Butchers' Guildhall, and the
carving upon the outside, as well as the inside, is
extremely ornate.

</div>

<p>The road to Rhayader traverses part of the Upper
Wye Valley, and gives frequent glimpses of
troubled, foam-flecked water, alternating with long
reaches where the river slides smoothly along its
rocky bed. The setting is one of pastoral scenery,
bounded by the rounded uplands, which help to
form the catchment basin for the great lakes which
now supply Birmingham with water. This gigantic
undertaking, to be extended altogether over fifty
years, will eventually be the means of constructing
a chain of lakes in the vale of the Elan, effectually
providing for the future needs of the great manufacturing
metropolis so far as water is concerned.</p>

<p class="location">RHAYADER</p>

<p>The chief attraction at Rhayader is the scenery,
as nothing of particular importance meets the eye
in the town. It is a good sketching-ground for
artists, many excellent subjects being discoverable
in the surrounding country. To the angler it is a
paradise. Although it possesses two churches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>
they are not worthy of the time required for inspecting
them. The <span class="wider">Wye</span> here is an impetuous
mountain stream, plunging amid the rocks strewn
along its course; to this point the salmon reach
the upper waters at the spawning season. Between
Rhayader and Builth there are several very sharp
turnings in the road, requiring considerable care if
risks are to be avoided. The <span class="wider">Wye</span> is close to the
road at many parts of its course, and forms the
boundary between the counties of Brecon and
Radnor. Farther on the stream begins to lose its
torrential character, and, traversing this well-wooded
valley, assumes more of the calm and
placid character with which one generally associates
it. It receives the superfluous water from the
great lakes of the Birmingham Corporation
Reservoirs by the Afon Elan soon after passing
Rhayader. To the west of Newbridge-on-Wye,
Lysdinam Hall, the ancestral home of the
Venables, is seen upon an eminence.</p>

<p class="location">BUILTH WELLS</p>

<p>This ancient town, the <i>Bullæum</i> of the Romans,
is the centre of trade for the neighbouring districts,
and derives much importance from its wells&mdash;saline,
sulphurous, and chalybeate. The population
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
is less than 2,000, but probably a regiment
might be raised locally all bearing the surname of
Price or Powell.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span>, or rather the site of it, is near the
town, close to the Wye Bridge. It possesses a
double fosse, a rampart of earth, and a keep,
which, judging from the foundation, must have
been of great size. It was besieged and captured
by Llewelyn in 1260.</p>

<p>The scene of Llewelyn's death in 1282 lies near
the Radnor road at Cefn-y-Bedd, a few miles from
the town. The Prince was refused a refuge in
Builth (hence 'The Traitors of Builth'), and,
reversing his horse's shoes, fled in the deep snow
for safety, but was overtaken and slain.</p>

<p>The church of Builth is a modern erection, and
the town is uninteresting.</p>

<p>The road from Builth to Talgarth passes through
Erwood, at some five miles' distance, and Garth
Hill, crowned by an earthwork, lies to the left; it
is also the place where the English troops in quest
of Llewelyn forded the river in 1282. Two miles
away to the left are the celebrated Falls of Craig-pwl-du,
a fall of 40 feet into a weird ravine. The
neighbourhood is full of interest to the antiquary
and the geologist. About three miles beyond
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>
Erwood the castle and woods of Llangoed are
passed, and Boughrood Castle appears on the left.
<span class="wider">Lyswen</span> is reputed to have been an early residence
of the Welsh Princes. The general character of
the road between Builth and Talgarth may be
stated as not wildly grand, but an exquisite combination
of river scenery with eminently beautiful
surroundings, where the ruggedness of the rocks is
softened by a covering of verdure, and foliage in
subtle gradations of beauty appears on every hand.
It is probably one of the most splendid roads for
scenery of this character in the Principality.</p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-223" id="i-223"></a>

At this point the view embraces some of the finest river scenery in Britain.</p>
</div>

<p class="location">TALGARTH</p>

<p>This quiet little town, nestling under the shadow
of the Black Mountain, is chiefly noted for the
proximity of <span class="wider">Bronllys Castle</span>, one mile distant,
of Early English and reputed Norman architecture.
It is a round tower, 70 feet high, standing upon a
mound, and its history appears to have been lost.
The Black Forest now lies upon the left hand, and
upon the right, at a few miles' distance, is Llangorse
Lake, a large but shallow sheet of water
500 feet above sea-level, and much referred to as a
probable source for the future supply of water to
London. The scheme is considered a feasible one,
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
and the water would flow to the metropolis by
gravitation. According to tradition, the lake covers
the site of a large city which perished in some
terrible catastrophe&mdash;a similar type of legend to
that of Semmerwater in Wensleydale. As the road
nears Crickhowell the great Sugar Loaf (1,955 feet)
becomes prominent, with a number of small villages,
farmsteads, and cottages dotting the slopes of the
lower hills. The River Usk now appears descending
a valley from Brecon, together with the main road
from that place.</p>

<p class="location">CRICKHOWELL</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> is a building of some dignity, with
nave, chancel, aisles, and spire standing near the
bridge.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> remains consist of a square tower
in fair preservation, flanked by a round one, together
with tumbled mounds of masonry and earth.
Several beautifully-situated seats are near the
village. From Crickhowell to Abergavenny two
roads run, one on either side of the valley, that
upon the right being slightly longer, but it is more
picturesque. The Sugar Loaf Mountain lies to the
left across the valley, while an opening in the hills
to the right reveals a glimpse into the Black
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
Country of the South Wales Coalfield. Near
Llangrwyne there is a most romantic stretch of
country, with many beautiful features.</p>

<p class="location">ABERGAVENNY</p>

<p>This flourishing market town claims a high
antiquity in history as being the direct descendant
of the Roman <i>Gobannium</i>. Its quaint narrow
streets contain some houses of interest, while the
splendid country lying around tempts the tourist
to stay.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span>, standing upon an eminence overlooking
the Usk, was an important Norman stronghold.
William de Braose, in the twelfth century,
invited many Welsh chieftains to a Christmas
feast in the castle, and then foully murdered them;
in retaliation their relatives burnt the castle. It,
however, rose again, and came after a time into the
Warwick family, passing eventually to the Nevilles,
represented now by the Marquis of Abergavenny,
who lives at Neville Court, up the river. As a ruin,
now laid out as something between a tea-garden
and a recreation-ground, the castle is exceedingly
disappointing. The steeps of the Blorenge are well
seen from the terrace.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> is near the post office and market
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>
hall. The Herbert and Lewes Chapels are the chief
points of interest in it, but attention should be
drawn to the ancient carved-oak seats in the choir,
and also to the font. A colossal recumbent figure
of what must at one time have been a 'Jesse tree'
is preserved here; it is 10 feet long, and the stump
of the tree remains, springing from the side of
Jesse. When complete it must have formed a
splendid screen, standing behind the high-altar.
The wooden effigy of George de Cantelupe in the
Herbert Chapel (1273) is the finest example of
early wood-carving extant in these islands.</p>

<p>Near the church stands Priory Mansion, with a
good garden, and splendid oak panelling in the
interior.</p>

<p>Abergavenny is an ideal place for the budding
mountain-climber, who can have excellent practice
upon the Blorenge, the great Skyrrid, and the
Sugar Loaf.

</div>

<p>Soon after leaving Abergavenny the classic portico
of Coldbrook House, in its large park, is passed
upon the left. Looking backwards over the route,
the picturesque situation of Abergavenny is seen,
with the Sugar Loaf, nearly 2,000 feet in height,
towering up beyond. Upon the right Blorenge
Hill stands out boldly, a great rounded mass
clothed with plantations to the summit. It is a
prominent feature in the landscape for some time.</p>

<p>Between Abergavenny and Llanvihangel-on-Usk
the road follows the railway-line and the river, and
at the latter place a pretty stretch of Usk scenery is
met, while the fine church of Llangattock-juxta-Usk,
where there are some awkward turnings in the
road, is well worth a visit. Just beyond Llanvihangel
the road to Raglan branches off to the left,
and a glance backwards shows the great mass of
the Brecknock Beacons silhouetted against the
western sky. Clytha Castle, a building dating
from 1790, stands near this parting of the
ways. Although so near the border-line between
England and Wales, the stereotyped whitewashed
cottages of Wales are still to be seen.
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></p>

<p class="location">RAGLAN</p>

<p>The road to the castle turns to the left in the
middle of the village, and stops abruptly at a
meadow in which are the entrance-gates. (<i>Admission
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
to the castle 6d. at any reasonable
time on weekdays; on Sundays from
2.30 to 5.</i>)</p>

<p>A description of Raglan Castle that will
give an approximate idea of the exquisite beauty of
this ruin has yet to be written; many have attempted
it, but all have fallen short of the charming reality.
It is a poem in stone; a crystallized ideal of all
that was beautiful in medieval architecture; the
embodiment of centuries of progressive emulation
in castle-building, now mellowed by the hand of
time, and with its corners and rough edges covered
by clinging masses of creepers. It is eminently
the most beautiful ruin to be met with in this
western tour. The chief characteristic is undoubtedly
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
the detached keep, which was built
after the main structure; the element of romance
and mystery haunts one while looking down upon
the dark waters of the moat encircling this keep,
and one feels a disinclination to leave the place,
although other castles await one. No part of the
building is of a date anterior to Henry V., and it
was chiefly erected by Sir William ap Thomas and
his son, William, Earl of Pembroke, who was
beheaded in 1469.</p>

<p>Subsequent architecture, however, may be traced
down to the time of Charles I. It came into the
possession of the Beaufort family (the present
owner is the Duke of that name) by the marriage
of an ancestor. The Earl of Richmond, afterwards
Henry VII., was a prisoner here for a time,
and Charles I. sought refuge within these walls
after Naseby, in 1645. It was besieged by Fairfax
in 1646, and dismantled by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Raglan Church is not worthy of much attention if
time is short. The tower was rebuilt, it is said, after
having been demolished for strategic purposes by
Cromwell's orders.</p>

<p class="location">USK</p>

<p>Usk was formerly a Roman station, and in the
immediate vicinity there are several encampments,
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>
both Roman and British, where excellent views are
obtainable over the surrounding country, reaching
to the mountains near Abergavenny and to the
wooded summits about Monmouth.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span>, now dismantled and covered with
ivy, stands upon a prominent hill to the north; the
Parliamentarians were responsible for its destruction.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> is of Norman origin, with a tower
rebuilt in recent years.</p>

<p class="location">CAERLEON</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before</p>
<p>Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.'</p>
<p class="i14"><i>Idylls of the King.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The name of Caerleon brings vivid recollections
to the mind of the Round Table and King Arthur,
but its history commenced before the sixth century,
when the great Pendragon flourished. The name
Caerleon means 'The Camp of the Legion,' the
Roman <i>Isca Silurum</i>, the capital city of the province
of <i>Britannia Secunda</i>. After the Roman occupation
it became a seat of learning. Remains of
villas, Roman walls, and other traces of the conquerors
of the world, abound, and the local museum
is rich in treasures&mdash;chiefly of that period, but by
no means confined to it. The building is upon the
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>
farther side of the churchyard. (<i>There is no fixed
charge, but a box for contributions. Key at the
schoolhouse opposite.</i>) The church is Early English,
with traces of Norman work in it. To the right of
the schoolhouse a lane leads for about a hundred
yards to a field on the left, opposite a racecourse,
where the amphitheatre, 220 feet by 190 feet, may
be seen. Excavations have revealed the stone
seats surrounding this concave site, known locally
as 'King Arthur's Round Table.' In the main
street of the sleepy little town some old timbered
houses are found, and of the once famous castle
nothing now remains except a small tower, which
once protected the bridge over the river, behind
the Hanbury Arms Inn. The few houses upon
the other bank of the Usk are known as 'Ultra
Pontem,' a most remarkable instance of persistence
and survival. It is difficult when walking through
the streets of Caerleon to realize that London,
York, and this little place were once the three
chief cities of Britain.</p>

<p class="location">NEWPORT</p>

<p>Newport is an example of rapid growth from a
small market town into a flourishing port, with
extensive docks, wharves, and jetties. It, however,
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
may claim a high antiquity, for it formed a post
during the Roman period.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle.</span>&mdash;This was at one time an extensive
building, and the river face of it is still of impressive
proportions. For many years the ruin was occupied
by a brewery, but the town has lately gained
possession of the sadly-diminished fortress. A
deep moat, filled at high tide, defended the walls
of the bailey on the north, west, and south sides,
but all this has vanished, leaving only the eastern
side, with three imposing towers, washed by the
muddy waters of the Usk. The Norman Fitzharon,
who conquered Glamorgan, built a castle at
Newport towards the close of the eleventh century;
but the existing structure is three centuries later,
and was, to some extent, remodelled in the fifteenth
century. The town was protected by a wall as late
as Leland's time, and he speaks of three gates.
One of these was close to the inn, called the West
Gate to this day. Conspicuous in the High Street
is the house of the <i>murringer</i>, a person whose
duties were in connection with the guarding of
the wall.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church of St. Woollos</span> has been restored,
but preserves many of its Norman features, and
contains interesting memorials, some of them of
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
considerable antiquity. A remarkable feature is
the separation of the tower from the church by
a small building, the Chapel of St. Mary, believed
by some ecclesiologists to be the primitive church
founded <i>c.</i> 550, and, if so, the most ancient building
still used for Christian worship in the United
Kingdom. The two structures are divided by a
good Norman arch, the columns of which appear
to be of Roman origin, and were possibly brought
from Caerleon.</p>

<p>During the Chartist riots the Mayor of Newport,
backed by some soldiers, defended himself from a
mob headed by Jack Frost. Bullet marks may be
seen upon a wooden pillar in the West Gate Hotel,
where the Mayor concentrated his defence, many of
the rioters being killed and wounded.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The road from Newport to Caerwent gives wide
views over the alluvial flats between it and the
Estuary of the Severn, protected from inundations
by extensive embankments, while to the north the
great woods lying upon high land are a pleasing
contrast. At first the road is nearly flat, but it
becomes undulating near Caerwent. This road is
part of the <i>Via Julia</i>, which commenced near the
mouth of the Severn, passed through Caerwent
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>
and Caerleon, and terminated at Neath in Glamorganshire.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Cencoed Castle</span> lies upon the right hand; the
remains are not very extensive, consisting chiefly
of a gateway flanked with turrets. A mansion
was at one time incorporated with the main portion
of the castle, but was subsequently abandoned, and
now the whole of the buildings form a farmhouse.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Penhow Castle</span> lies by the side of the road,
near the village of the same name. A short time
after the Norman Conquest this fortress was in the
possession of the Seymours. It seems to have
been at one period fairly extensive, but only an old
square tower with battlements remains, and this
also has been converted into a farmhouse.</p>

<p class="location">CAERWENT</p>

<p>is a small village with no pretensions of importance,
although the descendant of a strong Roman town.
The walls stand from 10 to 12 feet thick, are well
preserved, and are similar in many respects to
those at Carnarvon. A good facing of stone is
backed up by a solid mass of concrete, and then
a supporting bank of earth is raised behind them.
The church occupies a prominent position, but
does not possess any noteworthy feature. <span class="wider">Caldicott</span>
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>
<span class="wider">Castle</span>, lying to the south of the route, has extensive
remains of the foundation of the twelfth
century, and at the same time some indications
of Saxon work belonging to the previous fortalice
built upon the site. Passing Crick, Mathern is
perceived upon the right. The Bishops of Llandaff
had a palace here in medieval times, and
portions of it are still in existence, incorporated
with the modern farm-buildings.</p>

<p class="location">CHEPSTOW</p>

<p>is a market town and river port occupying a
slope on the western bank of the Wye, and surrounded
by beautiful and sometimes imposing
scenery.</p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-241" id="i-241"></a>
<img src="images/i-241.jpg" width="550" height="406" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COMING NIGHT, NEAR BEDDGELERT.<br />
	Beddgelert is one of the most romantically situated villages in North Wales.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> is the dominating feature in the
town, and is one of the finest examples of a Norman
fortress that has been preserved. It stands upon a
rocky eminence, and occupies nearly three acres.
Founded by Fitz-Osborn, Earl of Hereford, in the
eleventh century, it was almost rebuilt in the
thirteenth. It was garrisoned by the King during
the Civil War, but surrendered in 1645 to the
Parliamentarians. The castle was divided into
four great courts, and a number of round towers
defended the exterior walls, while a deep ditch
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
upon the land side, now used as a public resort,
completed the defences.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church of St. Mary</span> is built near the
river, and is coeval with the castle. A priory stood
here in the time of King Stephen, and the nave
of the present church is the nave of the priory
chapel. The larger part of the building is Norman,
while the western doorway is an exceptionally fine
example of the period. The tombs of Somerset,
second Earl of Worcester, and Elizabeth, his
Countess, are worthy of special notice.</p>

<p>The road to Tintern gives at first a view of the
remains of an ancient bridge opposite Chepstow
Castle, which, when in use, rose and fell with the
tide. Piercefield Park lies upon the right hand, with
an early camp amongst the trees. At St. Arvans
the road bears to the right, and a number of S
turns are met. Near here is the well-known 'Lovers'
Leap.' Moss Cottage stands by the road farther on,
with the Windcliff, famous for its glorious view of
the Wye, above it. Upon the opposite bank of
the river, and beyond the railway, is a lengthy
section of Offa's Dyke, and probably a glimpse
may be obtained from the road of the Devil's
Pulpit.
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></p>

<p class="location">TINTERN ABBEY</p>

<p>Tintern Abbey occupies a beautiful site upon
one of the loveliest rivers in England, and the
ruins have been claimed by many as the most
picturesque in existence; but many other roofless
abbey churches, placed in the same exquisite surroundings,
would appear to equal advantage, and
one is inclined to attribute Tintern's fame to its
scenery rather than to its architecture. The abbey
owes much to Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, and
a descendant of the De Clares, who, according to
the records, provided for extensive building in the
middle of the thirteenth century; but much of the
architecture, especially that in the south wall of
the chapter-house, speaks of an earlier date. The
cloisters are late Perpendicular (1469), and were
undoubtedly of great magnificence. The abbey was
dissolved in 1537, and since then the buildings have
gradually fallen into decay. The structural parts
which may be recognized are: the church, with
north and south transepts; cloisters, on the north
side of the nave; sacristy and monks' library,
adjoining the north wall of the north transept;
chapter-house and monks' parlour, monks' dayroom,
parlour, refectory and almoner's room, all
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>
to the north; together with the kitchen, buttery,
lavatory, and other small rooms.</p>

<p>The road from Tintern accompanies the Wye in
conjunction with the railway-line, and beautiful
hanging woods, broken up with grey cliffs, form
lovely backgrounds to every view.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Tintern Parva</span> is a small hamlet with a church
erected in the Early English period, but not of
great interest. At Bigsweir Bridge the river is
crossed and the turning to the left taken. Offa's
Dyke now lies upon the right hand.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Redbrook</span> is a village placed in a small combe
of great beauty. The church, with its Perpendicular
tower, is worth seeing. The monuments to John
Joce and his wife, <i>temp.</i> Edward III., are preserved
there, together with two priests and a brass showing
a 'free miner.'</p>

<p class="location">MONMOUTH</p>

<p>The situation of Monmouth is an ideal one, as it
is surrounded by hills, through which the Wye, the
Monnow, and the Trothy flow. It was at one time
fortified by a surrounding wall pierced by four gates;
but the Monnow, or Western Gate, dating from
1270, is regarded by some writers as a toll-gate
rather than one of those belonging to the wall.
This gate stands upon the Monnow Bridge, and
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
is a strikingly picturesque feature of the town.
Of the Roman origin of Monmouth (the <i>Blestium</i>
of Antoninus) there are at present no traces, but it
was a fortified station as early as the Saxon period.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church of St. Mary</span> was rebuilt from the
designs of Street in 1881, with the exception of the
tower and the tall and very slender spire. Near it,
in Priory Street, is a building called 'Geoffrey's
Study,' possessing a Perpendicular window corbelled
out on brackets. It cannot possibly have been
used by Geoffrey of Monmouth, after whom it is
named, as he died in 1154. The building, or,
more correctly, the old portion of it, is a remnant
of the domestic buildings of the Benedictine Priory.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Thomas's Church</span>, in Overmonnow, contains
some Norman architecture. Near the door
of the church stands an elaborate cross.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Shire Hall</span>, built in 1724, has a solemn
façade bearing in the centre a niche filled with a
metal statue of Henry V., the hero of Agincourt.
One cannot be long in Monmouth without being
reminded of Harry of that ilk, for the square in
front of the Shire Hall, formerly the bull-ring, is
now called Agincourt Square. Many quaint old
houses and inns still exist in the town, the Robin
Hood in Monnow Street and the Queen's Head
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
in Wyebridge Street being good examples of the
picturesque hostelry, so attractive after journeying
for many miles in Wales, where every town is
uniformly dreary in its architecture. Monmouth
Castle stood on a raised site close to the church.
It was a ruin at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and where the keep stood there is a house
of that period. There are still, however, some
sections of walls, and one window of the great hall
survives.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>On leaving Monmouth by the Ross Road, the
little parish church of <span class="wider">Dixton</span> is soon encountered,
and farther on the beautiful level height called
King Arthur's Plain is seen across the river. At
times it presents the appearance of towers belonging
to a castle.</p>

<p class="s08">
(It is advisable not to take cars down the road marked 'To
Symond's Yat and the Hotel,' between Kerne Bridge and
Whitchurch, as it is very narrow and rough. The road from
Whitchurch is better.)</p>

<p><span class="wider">Symond's Yat</span> is a rock which towers up to
800 feet above the surface of the river. The ascent
is quite easy, and from the upper part a magnificent
view is to be obtained. The scenery at this part of
the Wye is of quite exceptional beauty. Between
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>
the road and Symond's Yat two hills&mdash;the Great
and Little Dowards&mdash;occur. Upon the top of the
latter is a fine British camp, reputed to have once
been occupied by Caractacus.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Whitchurch</span> is a pretty little village possessing
an Early English church dedicated to St. Dubricius,
Archbishop of Caerleon in the sixth century. The
remains of a stone cross have been restored. After
leaving Whitchurch, the roads become somewhat
confusing, and care should be taken at the turns.
At the foot of the bridge carrying the main road
over the river stands Flanesford Priory, which was
erected in 1347. From Kerne Bridge a magnificent
prospect of the Wye is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Goodrich Castle</span> was an early residence of the
Earls of Shrewsbury (the Talbots) and there is little
doubt that the ruins now seen upon these rocky
heights are all that is left of one of the first castles
built in England, dating well back into the Saxon
period. The keep was built in the time of Stephen,
and it will be noticed that no windows look away
from the castle. In the Civil War it was taken
by the Parliamentarians, with the inevitable result.
It is a noble and imposing ruin, and a journey up
the Wye Valley should not omit a visit to Goodrich
Castle.
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">Goodrich Court</span> lies half a mile north of the
castle. It was built in the early part of the last
century by Sir Samuel Meyrick, the well-known
authority upon, and collector of, ancient arms and
armour, and also the author of valuable works upon
the same subject. The fine collection was sold
some time since, and the house purchased in 1870
by Mr. George Moffatt.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Goodrich Church</span> stands in the little village of
that name near the Court, and should be visited, as
the stained-glass windows are good. The ancestors
of Dean Swift resided in the parish, and one of
them was the Vicar and a notable Royalist.</p>

<p>The main road to Ross now leaves the Wye, but
in order to see Wilton Castle, that passing near the
river should be taken.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Wilton Castle</span> was built soon after the Norman
Conquest. It stands near the river upon ground
which is not elevated, and was erected to protect
the Welsh marches. It has been held by various
families&mdash;the Longchamps, the De Greys, and that
of Chandos. It suffered from the Parliamentary
army in 1645. The remains consist of the outer
walls only. A footpath will be found running
between the walls and the river.</p>

<p>Wilton Bridge is a well-known landmark near
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>
Ross. It was built in the reign of Elizabeth, and
consists of six arches. One of them&mdash;that near
Wilton&mdash;is more recent than the others, having
been rebuilt since its destruction by the Roundheads
during the Civil War.</p>

<p class="location">ROSS,</p>

<p>a picturesque little town with the steepest of
streets, is perched upon uneven rocky ground
high above the left bank of the Wye, and is surrounded
by hills on three sides. It was a town at
the time of Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Market Hall</span> stands prominently in the
centre of the town, and its quaintness adds much
to the attractiveness of the place. It was built
in the time of Charles II., and the upper part is
now used for the County Court and Petty Sessions.
On the exterior of the south wall one notices a
curious carving of the letters F and C, with a heart,
reputed to be 'faithful to Charles in heart.' The
'Man of Ross,' who was famed for his good deeds,
and is alluded to by Pope, lived opposite the
Market Hall. The lower part of the house is now
a stationer's shop. The good man's name was John
Kyrle, and his portrait, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, can
be seen in the upper room of the Market Hall,
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>
together with his will and an autograph letter,
dated 1695.</p>

<div class="figcenter p4"><a name="i-250" id="i-250"></a>

<p class="caption">TINTERN ABBEY.<br />
Showing the beautiful reach of the Wye which flows between steep wooded scarps.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> stands on higher ground than the
rest of the town, on the south-west side. It is
chiefly Early English, and has a nave with aisles,
chancel, and three chapels. One of the chapels
on the south side has a parvise over it. Probably
the feature which the average visitor finds most
interesting is the presence of two elm-trees growing
out of the wall inside the church. Both saplings
are now dead, but some creepers running over them
afford sufficient foliage to simulate vitality.</p>

<p>There is an Easter sepulchre in the chancel, and
a tablet opposite the organ contains sage reflections
upon man's life and destiny. Of the monuments
remaining in the church, one, dated 1637, of a
knight and lady, is probably one of the most perfect
memorials of contemporary costume to be found in
any church. The 'Man of Ross,' who follows the
visitor wherever he goes in this town, lies interred
under a flat slab, and against the wall is preserved
a splendid marble monument to his memory, erected
in 1766 by a relative. A door leading to the vanished
rood-loft is on the north side of the chancel arch.
The loft apparently contained a piscina similar to
Eastbourne Old Church.
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">Of Ross Castle</span> but little remains at the present
time to give an idea of its former importance and
extent. A tower, which may be entered, stands
near the church, and in the High Street another
portion is seen. From the first-mentioned there
is a beautiful view, including Symond's Yat, the
Great and Little Dowards, with a fine range of hills
upon the horizon, and a splendid loop of the Wye
lying at one's feet, with Wilton Castle and the
bridge in the foreground. Ross is in many ways
a capital centre for exploring the Wye Valley.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The road between Ross and Gloucester for about
half the distance lies in a picturesque piece of
country on the northern confines of the Forest
of Dean, chiefly covered with coppices, grown for
the sale of the bark, the manufacture of charcoal,
and the distillation of wood-spirit. It is one of
the wildest portions of Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Weston-under-Penyard</span> is a small village near
the ruins of <span class="wider">Penyard Castle</span> and the conspicuous
hill of that name. The church was restored in 1870,
and is not of great interest. Near this village is the
site of the ancient <i>Ariconium</i>. The rise to Lea affords
a view of considerable interest backwards, extending
as far as Graig Serrerthin in Monmouthshire.
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">Lea Church</span> stands beside the road, and possesses
a remarkable font of Indian workmanship inlaid
with mosaic. The base represents an elephant,
from which springs a twisted, snake-like column
supporting the basin. Nearly two miles to the
south of the road lies the village of Mitcheldean.
The Early English spire of the church is occasionally
seen through the trees, as it stands upon high
ground.</p>

<p>A number of sharp turns now occur, and the rise
to Dursley Cross is a steady one. The road is
good, and a splendid view may be obtained from
the summit, which is 500 feet above sea-level. A
long descent eventually leads to Huntley, lying
upon the lowlands which surround Gloucester.
After crossing the Severn, the ruins of <span class="wider">Llanthony
Abbey</span> can be seen to the south. The whole of
this comparatively level country is of the most
beautiful description, covered with English homesteads
nestling among orchards, which are quite
exquisite in spring-time.</p>

<p class="location">GLOUCESTER</p>

<p><span class="wider">Gloucester</span>, the <i>Glevum</i> of the Romans and
the <i>Glow Ceaster</i> of the Saxons, lies in the centre
of a broad valley, and possesses a history of no
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>
mean order. The Saxon kings made the place
their residence, and in 681 founded a nunnery,
which subsequently became a monastery and the
nucleus of the present cathedral. Parliaments
have been summoned in this city, and its connection
with the Empress Matilda in the time of
Stephen is well known. In the Civil War, Gloucester
was on the side of the Parliament, and resisted a
Royalist army in 1643&mdash;a regrettable fact, to which
must be attributed the demolition of the city walls
at the Restoration.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Cathedral</span> has dignified surroundings, and
velvety turf runs up to the weather-stained masonry.
The most prominent architecture to arrest the eye
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>
is the Perpendicular, of which, from the exterior,
the cathedral appears mainly to consist, although
Norman, Early English, and Decorated are all
represented. The Perpendicular south porch is
richly decorated, and possesses a parvise. Upon
entering, the enormous Norman columns of the
nave, standing closely together and towering
upwards, at once fix the attention. The semicircular
arches upon them appear small when
compared with other cathedrals, while the triforium
and clerestory are dwarfed and rendered
comparatively unimportant. The zigzag and
chevron work in the bays is of excellent
character. The choir is pure Perpendicular and
probably unsurpassed, and the glass in the large
window is old and a grand example of medieval
work. The bold and original idea of ornamenting
comparatively plain Norman work with the delicate
beauty of the Perpendicular has been carried out
to the fullest perfection. The vaulting of the roof
should be especially noted. The monument on
the north of the choir, of Osric, King of Mercia,
729, was probably made about 1520. Next to it is
the splendid monument of the unhappy Edward II.,
whose wasted career was terminated at Berkeley
Castle, where he was murdered in 1377. Above
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>
the altar-tomb is a beautifully sculptured effigy
of the King in alabaster, resting under a gorgeously
elaborate canopy. It is interesting to remember
that this tomb&mdash;one of the finest of the royal
monuments in England&mdash;was put up to a vain
and worthless King by his son and successor, whose
reign helped to make the country prosperous, while
the man whose memory is perpetuated in richly
carved alabaster allowed his father (Edward I.), a
great and courageous King, to rest under the five
plain slabs of marble to be seen in Westminster
Abbey. The recumbent effigy of Abbot Parker,
last Abbot of Gloucester, should be noticed. The
chantry, however, is a cenotaph.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The North and South Transepts</span> are Norman,
enriched with Perpendicular work. From these
points the flying arches, added to relieve the strain
on the piers supporting the central tower arches,
are features of grace and beauty. The north and
south choir aisles each possess a side-chapel, in one
of which Robert, Duke of Normandy, lies. He
died in 1134 in Cardiff Castle, after an imprisonment
of twenty-six years. <span class="wider">The Lady Chapel</span>
is of magnificent Perpendicular work. There are
chapels also leading from the choir triforium, superimposed
upon those below. <span class="wider">The Crypt</span> is Early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>
Norman work. <span class="wider">The Cloisters</span> are the finest in
England, the roof being vaulted with fan-tracery,
said to be the earliest example. In the north walk
of the cloisters is the lavatory, with a long trough
at which the monks washed, still in a perfect state,
while in the wall opposite is a place for the towels.
In the south walk are twenty recesses where the
monks studied or wrote. The whole of the windows
in these cloisters are filled with stained glass. <span class="wider">The
Chapter-house</span> is of plain Norman work, with the
exception of one small portion. By its side is the
abbot's cloister, over which is the chapter library,
containing some manuscripts of great value.</p>

</div>

<p>The cathedral has a number of interesting ruins
on the northern side. These include the remains
of a Dominican monastery, founded in the ninth
century and rebuilt in 1115, of which some arches
and pillars remain. There are other buildings
partially adapted for modern purposes.</p>

<p>Gloucester also possesses some churches of considerable
interest, such as <span class="wider">St. Mary de Lode</span>,
said to be the oldest in the city, with the Norman
chancel and tower of the original building. In the
churchyard stands a monument to Bishop Hooper,
burnt alive on the spot in 1555. <span class="wider">St. Mary de
Crypt</span> is of Early English workmanship, and
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>
derives its name from two large crypts beneath
it. It stands in Southgate Street, and has a
beautiful and lofty tower. <span class="wider">St. Michael the
Cross</span> was rebuilt in 1815, but incorporates original
Decorated work. It is said to have a connection
with the ancient Abbey of St. Peter. The curfew
bell is still rung from the tower every evening.
<span class="wider">St. Nicholas</span>, in Westgate Street, also contains
Norman and Early English work.</p>

<p>One of the greatest charms of Gloucester lies in
the multiplicity of houses to be found which range
in date from the fourteenth to the seventeenth
century, and a ramble through the streets will
disclose many besides those seen with a hurried
glance. The New Inn, for example, despite its
unpromising name, possesses a courtyard with
surrounding gallery eminently medieval in every
respect, and the feeling is not lessened by a descent
into the adjoining vaults. It was built in 1450 by
John Twining, a monk, for the accommodation of
pilgrims to the shrine of Edward II. It may be
of interest to note that the wood employed is
chestnut. A fine old timbered house stands in
Northgate Street, but has been refronted. A
passage, however, affords a view at the side. There
are many other examples of old domestic architecture
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>
to be found at the junctions of the four
principal streets in the centre of the town, where,
it may be mentioned, the Town Hall stands upon
the site of the ancient Courts of Justice.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In selecting a motoring centre in this part of
England, the writer has found Gloucester to be a
very suitable one in every way. The Bell and
County Hotel has a large garage, and combines
in a very exceptional manner the charm of the
old-fashioned English hostelry with the needs of
the present day. Apart from the long routes
described in these pages, there are many short
runs from Gloucester to pretty villages in the
Cotswolds and to historic spots, such as Berkeley
Castle, Llanthony Abbey, Deerhurst Priory, and
a dozen other places, which a local handbook will
point out. Nearly all the important places in the
neighbourhood are described in this book.

<p class="center">(<i>For description and plan of</i> <span class="wider">Hereford</span>, <i>see
<a href="#Page_176">pp. 176-179</a></i>.)</p>

<p>The road to Leominster passes due north out
of Hereford by, or rather through, the racecourse,
and directly afterwards <span class="wider">Holmer Church</span> is seen
upon the left side of the road. It belongs to Early
English times, and has a detached tower.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Moreton-on-Lug</span> has a church which has
recently been restored, but it contains some altar-tombs
of the Dauncer family. From this point
onwards Robin Hood's Butts and the Sugar Loaf
Hills become prominent objects in the landscape
on the left, their rugged summits of sandstone
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>
resisting the action of the weather better than the
soft marls through which they protrude.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Sutton Walls</span> lie to the right upon a wooded
hill, and are of great historical interest. Offa, king
of Mercia, had a palace there, and to it Ethelbert,
king of the East Angles, was invited, the ostensible
object being his marriage to the daughter of the
Mercian king. The young prince was foully
murdered by the connivance of Quendrida, Offa's
queen, and East Anglia annexed to Mercia in
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 782. In expiation of this deed Offa founded
the great monastery at St. Albans. There is a large
encampment upon the hill, with four entrances,
apparently of Roman origin, and containing an
area of about thirty acres.</p>

<p>Entering a low-lying district, upon which stands
Wellington Marsh, <span class="wider">Marden Church</span> is seen upon
the right, the place of Ethelbert's first interment,
the original building having been erected by Offa.
<span class="wider">Wellington Church</span>, lying to the left of the road,
is chiefly of modern construction. Two miles farther
on a bifurcation occurs, and the road to the right
may be taken if one wishes to avoid the rather
steep way leading over Dinmore Hill. <span class="wider">Bodenham</span>
is the next village on the route. It possesses
a large church of the Early English and Decorated
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>
Periods, containing an alabaster tomb of Sir Walter
Devereux, 1401. In the village will be seen the
remains of a large cross and a well. A sharp turn
to the left at England's Gate leads back in a few
miles to the junction with the main road near
<span class="wider">Hope-under-Dinmore</span>, crossing the River Lug
just before the junction. Hope Church, standing
on the hill-side, contains many tablets to the
Coningsby family. About two miles to the right
of Ford lies Risbury Camp, of an oval form, with
deep ditches surrounding it, and containing an area
of about eight acres. <span class="wider">Hampton Court</span> was built
by Sir Roland Lenthall in the time of Henry IV.,
and much enlarged by ransoms subsequently
obtained from prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt.
It was once the home of the Earl of Coningsby.
Mr. J. H. Arkwright, a descendant of Richard
Arkwright, is now the owner. The Court has been
partially rebuilt.</p>

<p class="location">LEOMINSTER</p>

<p>This town presents an exceedingly picturesque
aspect, a number of medieval or Renaissance buildings
having survived. It was a place of importance
in the days of the Heptarchy, and a monastery was
instituted by Merewald, king of the West Mercians,
in the seventh century, which, however, disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>
subsequently in the Danish invasions. A residence
of the Saxon kings, together with a stronghold,
was also raised here, only to be destroyed in a
Welsh raid in 1088. In 1125 Henry I. established
a Benedictine cell under the rule of Reading Priory,
and the buildings now form part of the workhouse!</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> includes examples of almost every
style of architecture. The nave is Norman, and
originally formed part of the Priory Church standing
upon this site. The monuments are very numerous,
and some of the finest window tracery in any
ecclesiastical building in the British Isles exists here.
A fire in the eastern parts of the church in 1699
led to a restoration in a very debased style. The
Butter Cross is an object of interest, and in the
Bargates are Georgian almshouses dating back to
1736. They have an effigy with an inscription
containing an admonition against the exercise of
charity without discrimination. The road to Ludlow
lies upon the eastern side of the railway, and
a sharp turn to the right occurs in the town.
<span class="wider">Ivington Camp</span> is a British earthwork, but was
considerably strengthened by Owen Glendower
when he retreated from Leominster and was
vigorously pursued by Prince Henry. One mile
to the right lies Eaton Hall, now a farmhouse. It
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>
was erected in the time of Henry V., and was once
occupied by the old family of Hakluyt.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="wider">Eye</span> lies to the left of the road, and has a church
with some fine alabaster monuments in it&mdash;one
figure with the collar of SS. Berrington Hall and
Park, the seat of Lord Rodney, are close by. The
country passed through for some miles past is a
cider district, and numerous orchards can be seen
on every side. Near Woofferton is a fine open
stretch of country, in which the highlands upon
the left, wooded to their summits, form a welcome
break. <span class="wider">Richard's Castle</span>, of the motte and bailey
type, lies under the hills. It was erected in the
reign of Edward the Confessor, and stands upon
a mound 60 feet in height, with some peculiar
earthworks adjoining. It is a matter for remark
that this stronghold was erected and occupied by
a Norman, Richard, the son of Scrop, <i>before</i> the
Conquest, and thus is one of a little group of castles
of peculiar interest. An old church at the town of
Richard's Castle has a detached belfry.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A Welsh family, of whom Richard Hakluyt (1552?-1616),
the famous geographer, is the best known.</p>

<p class="location">LUDLOW</p>

<p>This is an ancient British town lying in an amphitheatre
of high ground, but no reliable history relating
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>
to the place is extant until after the Conquest,
when Roger de Montgomery founded the <span class="wider">Castle</span>,
which for a considerable time was the residence
of Royalty, more particularly of Edward IV. and
his children. Ludlow was also the seat of the
Grand Council entrusted with the jurisdiction of
the Marches. The keep of the castle was erected
between 1086 and 1096. In the Civil War the
castle surrendered to the Parliamentary forces in
1646, at the same time as Bridgnorth. The appearance
of the dismantled fortress on an eminence
above the River Teme is imposing and impressive,
as the Norman towers and bastions, together with
a considerable portion of the curtain walls, are still
standing.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> stands upon elevated ground near
the castle, and is of Decorated Gothic, dating from
the time of Edward III., although originally built
in the twelfth century. It is dedicated to St. Lawrence,
and is a cruciform building with a lofty
tower, and one of the finest churches in England.
There is also a guildhall, a town-hall, and the
museum, chiefly confined to natural history, has
a grand collection of Silurian fossils. A very fine
timbered house, the Lane Asylum, dates from 1672.</p>

<p>From the district round Bromfield a fine view
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>
is obtained of Clee Hill lying to the right, with
Titterstone Camp, 1,749 feet above the sea, on it.
Farther to the north is Brown Clee Hill, 1,792 feet
high, with Corne Dale to the left. Near Onibury
the route is well wooded, and the valley becomes
contracted as the road leads through a break in Wenlock
Edge. Upon the right Norton Camp, a horseshoe-shaped
entrenchment, occupies the summit of
a knoll.</p>

<p class="location">STOKESAY CASTLE</p>

<p>is reached just before coming to Craven Arms
Station. It is, without exaggeration, one of the
most picturesque and also one of the earliest
fortified houses in the kingdom. From almost
any point of view it thrills the artist, the architect,
the archæologist, and the ordinary visitor who has
any capacity to read sermons in stones. The very
name 'Stokesay' tells the story of Norman owner
superseding Saxon, the Says or Sayes being
descendants of Picot de Sai, who came over with
the Conqueror, a similar instance being found in
Stoke d'Abernon in Surrey, where the Saxon 'Stoke'
is again tacked on to the name of the new Norman
owner. The gatehouse of the castle, although a
highly picturesque timber-framed building of Elizabethan
times, with a carving of Adam and Eve and
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>
the Serpent over the door, is not the most interesting
feature, for the rest of the building belongs to the
thirteenth century, and is quite one of the best
examples of a fortified house of the Early English
period. The moat is now dry, but otherwise one
can see in Stokesay the type of house close to
the Welsh Marches which was occupied by a lesser
feudal lord in the days when Wales was still the
home of unconquered tribesmen, who might at any
time make a sudden descent into English territory.
Facing the gateway is the hall, 51 feet by 31 feet
(internal measurements), lighted with four tall
lancet windows looking on to the moat on the
west side. The open timber roof is blackened
with smoke, for there was no fireplace, and the
smoke from the central brazier escaped through
an outlet in the roof. The builder of this hall is
given by the late Mr. Augustus Hare as John
de Verdun, who died in 1279, while the curious
and picturesque polygonal tower at the south
corner was no doubt built by Verdun's successor,
that Lawrence de Ludlow who received permission
from Edward I. to fortify his house of Stokesay.
It would be a pleasant task to describe every room
and every architectural detail of this fascinating
castle, but space unfortunately does not permit.
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> at Stokesay was rebuilt after the
Civil War. Beautiful views of the Long Mynd,
of Wenlock Edge, and the ridge lying between
them, now open up. The church at the little village
of <span class="wider">Wistanstow</span> has been restored, and during the
alterations a carved oak roof of the Perpendicular
period came to light.</p>

<p class="location">CHURCH STRETTON</p>

<p>is a village in an exceedingly pleasant situation,
with the Long Mynd ridge of hills to the west,
and with Hope Bowdler, Caer Caradoc, and the
Lawley nearly opposite. The name Stretton, like
Streatham, indicates the presence of a Roman road&mdash;one
of those leading southwards from the great
Roman city of <i>Uriconium</i>.</p>

<p>The interesting cruciform church has a Norman
nave with Transitional central tower and transepts.
Several Perpendicular windows have been inserted.
Mr. Hare mentions a stone in the churchyard, near
the sundial, bearing this inscription to Ann Cook,
who died in 1814:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'On a Thursday she was born,</p>
<p>On a Thursday made a bride,</p>
<p>On a Thursday broke her leg,</p>
<p>And on a Thursday died.'</p>
</div></div>
<p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></p>

<p>'Hesba Stretton,' the novelist, took her pen-name
from this village, where she lived for many years.</p>

<p>Near Church Stretton the site of Brockhurst
Castle is passed over. Bodbury Ring, to the left
beyond Church Stretton, is said to have been
occupied by Ostorius Scapula previous to his great
battle with Caractacus. The site of the engagement
is on the right, and a mile farther on the
road leads under Caer Caradoc Hill, 1,506 feet
high, with a perfect camp, vallum, and ditches
upon the summit, wherein Caradoc entrenched
himself previous to the fight. The district under
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>
the Long Mynd is extremely picturesque, with
deep gullies and cross valleys running into the
great ridge, whose elevation in places reaches to
1,600 feet. It is a paradise for geologists, deposits
emerging from underneath the Silurian which are
of more than ordinary interest. The Caradoc
Range is an old volcanic outburst. The line of
the Roman road traversing the valley already
mentioned may be noted running parallel with the
railway.</p>

<p>The route from Shrewsbury follows that to
<i>Uriconium</i> for nearly a mile, when a bifurcation
occurs, and the road to the right is chosen, passing
through Sutton and Cound. The church at the
latter place is chiefly of Early English architecture;
it contains a carved early Norman font of great
interest. The Wrekin, with Heaven's Gate Camp
upon it, is a prominent feature in the distance,
while the Severn indulges in sinuous windings by
the side of the road. <span class="wider">Buildwas Abbey</span> is quite
close to the road; it presents a beautiful aspect,
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>
and is one of the finest ruins in the county. The
abbey was founded by Roger de Clinton, Bishop
of Chester, in 1135, for Cistercians. Parts of it
still remain roofed. Coalbrookdale is historically
interesting as the cradle of the iron trade. It
sprang into prominence when the Sussex ironfields
had to be abandoned, owing to the shrinkage of
the forests there. In 1700 members of the Darby
family experimented upon iron ore smelted with
coal and coke, and since then it has been a centre
of the iron industry.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Ironbridge</span> contains nothing of any particular
interest. It is a town of foundries, forges, and
furnaces, while hideous tiers of dirty cottages
cluster on the steep hill-side. In the town is the
iron bridge from which the place gains its name;
it is a bridge of a single span, stretching 120 feet,
and is the first on record. Its presence is due to
the energy of Abraham Darby, of the Coalbrookdale
Works, in 1779. From Ironbridge the road
trends away from the Severn, passing through a
well-wooded country, and eventually reaches</p>

<p class="location">BRIDGNORTH</p>

<p>This picturesque town is reputed to have been
founded by a daughter of Alfred the Great, and
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>
was fortified with walls and a castle by Robert de
Belesme, Earl of Shrewsbury. Henry I. besieged
it in 1102, and in the time of Henry II. it was dismantled.
The walls suffered the same fate at the
hands of the Parliamentary forces after a long siege
in 1646. The upper town is built upon a steep
rocky plateau, which rises abruptly from the river,
crowned by the remains of the old castle, which
deviate remarkably from the vertical. A bridge of
fine design joins the upper to the lower town.</p>

<p><span class="wider">At Quatford</span> a fortress was built by Ethelfleda,
and subsequently a college by the wife of Roger
de Montgomery, from a romantic remembrance of
having first met her husband upon that spot. Slight
indications of a keep still remain upon a rock overlooking
the Severn. The church has the chancel arch
and font of the Norman period, and the remainder
is Decorated work of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The Forest of Morfe at one time covered the
whole of this district. Dudmaston Castle is passed
immediately before Quatt is reached, and then an
undulating run eventually leads to</p>

<p class="location">KIDDERMINSTER</p>

<p>The name of the town means the 'minster on
the brow of the hill.' From the time of William
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>
the Conqueror down to <i>c.</i> 1135 it was a manor in
possession of the Crown.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church.</span>&mdash;This is dedicated to St. Mary,
and is chiefly of the Perpendicular period. It
contains a number of ancient monuments, and
has recently undergone a restoration. The town
is celebrated for its manufacture of carpets; a
peculiar property of the River Stour is reputed to
add to the brilliancy of the colouring. Dyeing,
worsted-spinning, together with iron manufactures,
are carried on in the town.</p>

<p>On leaving Kidderminster the road lies almost
due south to <span class="wider">Stourport</span>, a rather uninteresting
town, possessing, however, an iron bridge over the
Severn. The church is of modern construction.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Ombersley</span> is a village of uncommonly neat
appearance, with many timbered houses effectively
rendered in black and white. The Court was
erected in the time of Queen Anne, and is the
country residence of Lord Sandys. The church
in the village is new.</p>

<p class="location">WORCESTER</p>

<p>is sheltered by the Malvern Hills on the south-west,
and by other picturesque eminences. A
Roman road originally traversed the city, and as
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>
early as the year 680 Worcester was surrounded
by lofty walls and fortifications, which, by existing
records, appear to have compared favourably with
other towns.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Cathedral.</span>&mdash;(<i>Open on weekdays 9.30 to 6,
but closed at 5.30 between October and March 31
[or dusk]. 6d. each charged for entering the Choir,
Lady Chapel, and other special portions.</i>) When
Mercia became an independent kingdom a church
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>
was raised, and subsequently another built by
Oswald in the tenth century a little north-east of
the present building. Wulfstan found Oswald's
church in ruins, the handiwork of Hardicanute's
soldiers. He began a new cathedral in 1084, but
two fires subsequently ruined it. Re-erected, it was
reconsecrated in 1218. The cathedral suffered but
little at the Reformation, but very much during
the Civil War. It is not a grand building so far
as massiveness is concerned, but possesses a variety
of styles which harmonize in a remarkable degree,
and a sense of unity pervades the whole building.
The tower is a beautiful specimen of Perpendicular
work, and has recently been thoroughly renovated.
The chief objects of interest in the interior are the
stalls, with their miserere seats, dating from 1397,
formerly in Worcester Priory; the cloisters, chapterhouse,
and remarkable Norman crypt, with King
John's tomb in the choir. There are picturesque
remains of the old Guesten Hall, the refectory and
dormitory.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Edgar Tower</span> stands near the entrance
to the cathedral cloisters. It was originally the
entrance to Worcester Castle, but the monks converted
it into a monastery gateway.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Guildhall</span> dates from 1721, and is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>
impressive building, containing some objects of
interest from the battlefield of Worcester.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Commandery.</span>&mdash;This is a hospital founded
in 1085; the great refectory and Guesten Hall,
with beautiful roofs and stained glass, should be
seen.</p>

<p>There are a number of old timbered houses
remaining in the city, especially in Friar Street,
near the city gaol, and in Lich Street. In the
Corn Market is King Charles's House, built 1577,
in which Charles II. took refuge in 1651 after the
Battle of Worcester. It has the inscription, 'Fear
God; honour the King,' over the doorway. In the
Trinity, not far off, is an interesting Elizabethan
house with an open gallery. The Royal Porcelain
Works, founded in 1751, are in Severn Street, near
the cathedral. (<i>Open 9.30 to 12.30, 2.15 to 5.
Admission 6d.</i>)</p>

<p class="location">GREAT MALVERN</p>

<p>Malvern is a watering-place, situated in a
beautiful district on the eastern slope of the
hills of the same name, and is much frequented
by reason of its fine air, its healthy surroundings,
and its mineral springs. A Benedictine
priory was founded here shortly after the
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>
Conquest, and one of the buildings, the <span class="wider">Abbey
Gateway</span>, dating from 1083, still remains.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> is of Norman work, with Perpendicular
additions, dating from the time of
Henry VII.; it originally formed the Priory
Church, and was purchased by the inhabitants
at the Dissolution, and made parochial. The
recumbent effigies in it are of considerable interest.</p>

<p>Between Malvern and Ledbury lie the Malvern
Hills; in crossing them one has to negotiate a hill
of 1 in 11. One is reminded of Touraine in the
quantities of mistletoe growing on the trees as the
quaint old town of Ledbury is neared.</p>

<p class="location">LEDBURY</p>

<p>The main street is full of charm in its possession
of several old houses and a market-house standing
on chestnut pillars. The upper portion has been
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>
much restored, but the wooden supports are those
of the building believed to have been put up by
John Abell in Elizabethan times.</p>

<p>The most notable feature of the church is the
detached Early English tower, now crowned with
a modern spire. Of the original Norman church
the western doorway remains in the Perpendicular
nave. Besides the tombs of the Biddulphs the
stained glass in the north chapel should be
examined. These windows are of the Decorated
period, and the chapel is dedicated to the local
St. Catherine, who lived at the beginning of the
fourteenth century. During the Civil War there
was a hot fight in Ledbury in the year 1645
between Prince Rupert and a body of Roundheads.
Marks of bullets can be seen on the
church doors and elsewhere in the town.</p>

</div>

<p>The extensive loop described briefly in this chapter
takes one to many interesting towns in Gloucestershire
and the neighbouring counties, and as there is
much to see, it is advisable to break the journey at
Bath, and possibly again at Broadway or Evesham,
in order not to be obliged to hurry through beautiful
scenery and romantic towns.</p>

<p>Although the level road from Gloucester to
Stroud by Hardwicke is to be recommended to
those who would avoid a long, stiff climb, the way
through the Cotswolds is so much more interesting
and so vastly more picturesque that it should by
all means be taken if the hill is of no consequence.</p>

<p>The easiest ascent of the face of the Cotswolds is
by the road through the village of Brookthorpe,
descending into the Painswick valley near the
secluded and quite typical Cotswold hamlet of
Pitchcombe.</p>

<p>A still more beautiful road goes through Sneedham's
Green, near Upton St. Leonards, and winds
up a long steady ascent among beeches. This road
is well engineered, and the views from it, first over
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>
the Vale of Severn and then into the Painswick
and Sheepscombe valleys, are full of exquisite
charm at all times of the year.</p>

<p class="location">PAINSWICK</p>

<p>is one of those little stone towns with that peculiarly
foreign flavour so frequently experienced in the
Cotswolds. Perched on a steep hill-side and
dominated by the tall tower and spire of its stately
church, the place is the centre of the life of a lovely
valley. Every other house in the town is a picture
by itself, and when grouped with others and backed
by the emeralds and blues of the opposite side of
the valley, the stranger can hardly be prevented
from exclaiming aloud as each corner brings some
new composition before him.</p>

<p>In the centre of the town stands the fine church,
with a unique churchyard, wherein a wonderful
array of richly carved altar-tombs of delicate
classic design are scattered in picturesque irregularity
under the sombre shade of rows of closely
trimmed yews. The stems of these trees are kept
clear of twigs and branches, and the masses of green
are shaped into great round-topped cylindrical
forms. Just below the church, beyond a group of
magnificent elms, stands Painswick Court, a stone,
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>
many-gabled house of
such reposeful dignity
that one seems to find in
it as nearly as possible
the ideal English manor-house
of modest proportions.
The title 'Court'
came to the house, not
in connection with the
manor, but through a
visit paid to it by
Charles I. in 1643. The
King slept in the house,
and issued a proclamation
'given at our Court at
Paynewicke.'</p>

<p>Whether one decides
to go through Painswick
or Pitchcombe, or even if
one keeps below the hills,
all the roads meet at</p>

<p class="location">STROUD</p>

<p>This is a hilly town
abounding in very steep
streets, and possessing, as
all Cotswold towns do,
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>
a number of good old stone houses of the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. It is, nevertheless,
a place without much appeal to the passing
motorist, for the church has been rebuilt in recent
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>
times, with the exception of the tower, which is
Early English. The Town Hall, formerly the
market-house, was built in the fifteenth century by
John Throckmorton of Lypiatt.</p>

<p>Stroud still maintains its woollen industry, and
thousands of people are employed in the mills in
the town and in the valley to the east.</p>

<p>Leaving Stroud for Bath, one ascends the valley
towards <span class="wider">Nailsworth</span>, a busy locality, where the
weaving of broadcloth is the chief industry. There
are also flock factories and workshops where beech&mdash;'the
weed of the oolite'&mdash;is used in making beds,
gunstocks, and umbrella-sticks.</p>

<p>A little beyond Nailsworth the road comes out
on the ridge of wind-swept hills, and continues a
slightly undulating course southwards to Bath,
a distance of over twenty miles, without a village
and scarcely a hamlet on the whole journey.
There are wide views in both directions, and some
grand panoramas across the Severn.</p>

<p>After dropping down from the level of the
downs, one turns to the right and enters the
ancient city of</p>

<p class="location">BATH</p>

<p>This wealthy, picturesque, and still popular watering-place,
is described at some length in another
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>
volume of this series&mdash;the Southern Section of
England&mdash;and it must therefore be dealt with in
the briefest fashion here. The thermal springs
attracted the Romans to the spot, and of their
city <i>Aquæ Solis</i> there are probably very considerable
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>
remains beneath the present city. <span class="wider">The
Baths</span> themselves have been excavated, and
several feet below the street-level one can now
see the Roman tanks filled, as they were some
sixteen centuries ago, with the steaming waters
which still bring many ailing folk to the town.
Besides the baths there is the <span class="wider">Abbey Church</span>,
a magnificent example of late Perpendicular work,
crowded with memorials to distinguished visitors
and residents of Bath, whose virtues and achievements
are not overlooked on the marble tablets.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="wider">Pulteney Bridge</span>, like the Ponte Vecchio, is
lined with shops, but the famous bridge at Florence
quite eclipses this structure of a much later and
less artistic age. In walking through the streets of
Bath one cannot fail to be struck by several of the
Georgian façades, whose dignity and classic perfection
reflect the formal manners of the latter part
of the eighteenth century, when Beau Nash drew
admiring and envious eyes upon his elaborately-attired
person as he passed along the stone-built
streets of the great centre of smart society when
George was King.</p>

<p>From Bath to Chippenham the road goes through
Batheaston, and keeping to the north side of the
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>
railway for a couple of miles, passes under it to
reach the village of <span class="wider">Box</span>, which has given its name
to one of the longest tunnels on the Great Western
Railway. It is one and three-quarter miles in
length, and cost more than half a million pounds
to build. Box village has a church belonging to
the three great periods of Gothic, with a Perpendicular
tower.</p>

<p>Going to the left in the village, the road to
Chippenham rises from the valley of the By Brook,
crosses the ridge of oolite and fuller's earth pierced
by the famous tunnel, and drops down to</p>

<p class="location">CORSHAM</p>

<p>The little town lies chiefly to the right, towards
the railway and Corsham Court, Lord Methuen's
stately Elizabethan house. It is quite desirable to
run through the place, returning to the Chippenham
road by the road that skirts the park, north of the
church. There are some old houses in the street,
and among them one dating back as far as the
fifteenth century. Corsham Court contains a magnificent
collection of paintings, mostly brought here
by Sir Paul Methuen, who was at one time Ambassador
to Madrid, and died in 1757.</p>

<p>The beautiful cruciform church was shorn of its
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>
central tower during the restoration by Street, who
built a new tower and spire in a rather unusual
position south of the south transept. The Norman
nave and a north door of the same period are the
earliest portions of the building, and the Methuen
Chapel, built in 1879, is the most recent.</p>

<p>From Corsham the road falls continuously to</p>

<p class="location">CHIPPENHAM,</p>

<p>an old manufacturing town on the Avon. As its
name suggests, it has been a market town from a
very remote age. It was a place of importance
in Saxon times, and one or two events are recorded
as happening there before the year 878, when the
Danes took the place and made it their headquarters,
while, with fire and sword, they spread
ruin and desolation over the neighbourhood. After
Alfred reappeared from his hiding-place in marsh-bordered
Athelney to the south-west, and gained
his famous victory over the marauding Danes at
Ethandune, he regained possession of Chippenham,
and gave it to his daughter Ælfrith for life. For
objects to connect the Chippenham of to-day with
these thrilling times of half-civilized Britain one
looks in vain, for the church, the most hopeful link,
reveals no Saxon work, and what is Norman has
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>
been so cruelly handled that its interest has
vanished. The richly-carved Norman chancel arch,
dating from about half a century after the Conquest,
has been recut and removed to the north
side of the chancel.</p>

<p>The modern church of St. Paul was built in
1853 by Sir Gilbert Scott. A new Town Hall
belongs to this period, but the old one is still
standing.</p>

<p class="location">MAUD HEATH'S CAUSEWAY</p>

<p>A very remarkable feature of Chippenham is a
paved track some four and a half miles in length,
and still bearing curious inscriptions, leading northeastwards
from the town to the ridge of Bremhill
Wick. This path owes its existence to a bequest
made by a certain Maud Heath, who lived as long
ago as the fifteenth century, and the cost of the
maintenance of the path at the present day is
defrayed by the property she bequeathed for the
purpose. Tradition says that Maud Heath was
a market-woman of Langley Burrell, a village on
the causeway; and if this is correct one imagines
that the good dame left her money to save those
that came after her the toil and discomfort of
trudging with a heavy basket in the deep mire
of the heavy clay of the valley. On the ridge
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>
where the path terminates stands a column bearing
a statue of the woman, put up in 1838 by the Lord
Lansdowne of that time&mdash;Bowood, the ancestral
home of the Lansdownes, from which Rembrandt's
'Mill' has lately been sold and removed to
America, being only two miles distant.</p>

<p>An undulating road goes almost due north to
Malmesbury, passing through the hamlet of
<span class="wider">Corston</span>, which has a small church with a curious
Perpendicular bell-turret at the west end.</p>

<p class="location">MALMESBURY</p>

<p>This interesting and historic town is comparatively
unknown to the ordinary tourist. Its situation
on a spur of raised ground, with two branches
of the Avon almost surrounding it with a natural
moat, made the place of importance in early days,
when such things were eagerly sought after. One
is not surprised, therefore, to find that the site was
a stronghold of the British, known as <i>Caer Bladon</i>,
and in Saxon times was a frontier town of Wessex.
According to Murray, the present name is derived
from Maidulph or Maldulph, an Irish missionary
who, about the beginning of the seventh century,
established a hermitage under the protecting proximity
of the castle, and there began educational
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>
work among the semi-barbarous Saxons. One of
his scholars was the learned Ealdhelm, who became
the first abbot of the monastery of Malmesbury,
founded in 680. Of the great religious house which
eventually grew up at Malmesbury only the
church remains, now, alas! sadly diminished and
curtailed. Both the central and the western
towers collapsed somewhere about the sixteenth
century, crushing the adjoining parts of the nave
and chancel in their fall. The existing church is
therefore only a portion of the nave of the magnificent
abbey church which dominated the little
town in pre-Reformation times. The arcades are
Transitional Norman with massive cylindrical pillars,
but above the arches rises a Decorated clerestory,
supporting a richly vaulted roof of the same period.
If it had not been for Master Humpe, whom
Leland describes as 'an exceeding riche Clothiar,'
there would quite possibly have been nothing left
at all of the abbey church after the suppression of
the monasteries; but this worthy man bought the
buildings from the Crown and presented the church
to the parish. The old parish church was utilized
as a town hall, but nothing remains of that structure
except the tower, with a spire.</p>

<p>The beautiful Elizabethan house to the north-east
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>
of the abbey church is built on a portion of
the monastic buildings in which Master Humpe
had set up his looms. The famous historian,
William of Malmesbury, who lived in the twelfth
century, was librarian and precentor of the abbey.
Before leaving the town the lovely Perpendicular
market cross should be seen, and also the almshouses
near St. John's Bridge.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Leaving Malmesbury by the Cirencester road,
one soon goes to the right for Cricklade, skirting
Charlton Park, with its dignified Jacobean house
built by Sir Thomas Knyvet, with a west front
designed, it is said, by Inigo Jones. It is the seat
of the Earls of Suffolk and Berkshire. The present
holder of the title was extra A.D.C. to Lord
Curzon of Kedleston, and married, in 1904, a sister
of the late Lady Curzon. The interior of the house
has been modernized, but it contains a remarkably
fine collection of old masters.</p>

<p class="location">CRICKLADE</p>

<p>This prettily-situated little town is on the Thames,
about ten miles from Thames Head, close to the
Foss Way, St. Sampson's Church, with its pinnacled
tower, rising picturesquely over the roofs
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>
half hidden among trees. It is a cruciform building,
and the interior of the tower, which is enriched with
armorial shields, contains a clock possessing no face
on the exterior! In the churchyard there is a fine
cross with niches in the head, and another is to be
found in the churchyard of the little St. Mary's.
Cricklade is one of those really ancient places
whose beginnings are far off in British times, the
origin of the name being the two British words
<i>cerrig</i> (stone) and <i>lád</i> (ford).</p>

<p>From Cricklade one goes south-west as straight
as an arrow for about four miles on the Roman
Ermine Way leading from Cirencester (<i>Corinium</i>)
to Speen (<i>Spinæ</i>), near Newbury. Then one goes
to the left to <span class="wider">Highworth</span>, where the route turns
due north and meets the Thames again at</p>

<p class="location">LECHLADE</p>

<p>The Lech and the Coln meet the Thames at the
town, and the united streams suddenly assume an
air of dignity, having reached a width of some
20 yards and a depth sufficient for vessels of
80 tons. Across the 'stripling Thames' there
stands the first stone bridge, whose core is the
medieval structure built somewhere about the
beginning of the thirteenth century, or possibly
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>
earlier, in the days when bridge-building was regarded
as a pious enterprise. In its prosperous days
Lechlade sent great quantities of cheese down
the river to London. The church is mainly Perpendicular,
dating, according to Bigland, from
about 1470.</p>

<p>Continuing northwards, the road climbs among
the eastern slopes of the Cotswolds, and reaches
picturesque old <span class="wider">Burford</span> (see <a href="#Page_276">p. 276</a>). The next
place to the north is</p>

<p class="location">SHIPTON-UNDER-WYCHWOOD,</p>

<p>an interesting and attractive old village on the east
side of Wychwood Forest. The spacious church
is chiefly an Early English building, with alterations
in Perpendicular times, and no indications at all of
Decorated work. The spire, like that of Witney,
is Early English, while the font and stone pulpit
are Perpendicular. Adding immensely to the
picturesqueness of the church, there is on the east
side a group of timeworn buildings of ecclesiastical
origin dating back to the time when Shipton was a
prebend of Salisbury Cathedral. One should also
notice the sixteenth-century work of the Crown
Inn, standing near the centre of the village.</p>

<p>Going on towards Chipping Norton, one comes
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>
after two miles to some tumuli, called Lyneham
Barrows, and not far beyond these there is a
standing stone about 6 feet high.</p>

<p class="location">CHIPPING NORTON,</p>

<p>another of the towns with the distinctive term
revealing an old-time importance as a market, is
the highest town in Oxfordshire, being nearly
700 feet above the sea. The place consists chiefly
of one long and picturesque street, and what there
is to tell of its history is almost exclusively in
relation to its cloth manufactures, its breweries, or
its glove factories. The conspicuous church is
mainly Decorated and Perpendicular, with the
tower above the obviously Early English work,
rebuilt in 1825.</p>

<p>There is a story of Bishop Juxon having been
the cause of a complaint to Cromwell because once,
when the prelate was hunting, the hare, closely
followed by the hounds, ran through the churchyard.
The Protector's reply, however, took the
form of a question: 'Do you think the Bishop prevailed
on the hare to run through the churchyard?'</p>

<p>Nothing whatever is left of the castle formerly
standing to the east of the church, but the almshouses,
built in 1640, still survive.
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></p>

<p>Chipping Norton is left by the road to Evesham,
and a run of eight miles brings one into the
long, wide street of <span class="wider">Moreton-in-the-Marsh</span>,
a little market town without any exceptional
features needing special reference here. The next
place, however, is <span class="wider">Bourton-on-the-Hill</span>, a lovely
village, with its old cottages perched either above
or below the steeply ascending road. Of the
gardens gaily decked with flowers one could write
many pages; but not far off is <span class="wider">Broadway</span>, one
of those delightful villages of the always lovely
Cotswolds, full of pleasing stone architecture, in
spite of the evil tendencies which have marred,
if not destroyed, the beauty of so many pleasant
old-world haunts. At the picturesque Lygon
Arms, at the lower end of the village, Charles I.
is said to have stayed on more than one occasion,
and near it is a house called the 'Abbot's Grange,'
where Mr. Millet, the artist, has his studio. This
was the manor-house of the Abbots of Pershore,
a Benedictine abbey possessing much property at
Broadway. There is a large hall open to the roof,
a solar, and a small chapel chiefly dating from
Decorated times. The old church of Broadway,
dedicated to St. Eadburgh, is three-quarters of a
mile away, in the Snowshill Valley. It contains a
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>
plain Norman font, a painted wooden pulpit of the
fourteenth century, and some good brasses. From
the tower, built in 1797, above the village one can
see a wide panoramic view over the beautiful
rounded hills, broken up by belts of beech and
larch.</p>

<p>If there is no need to economize time, it would
certainly be unwise to pass so near the picturesque
old town of <span class="wider">Chipping Camden</span> without having
a peep at its fine market hall, its church, and
beautiful array of stone-built houses. After this
the hills are left behind, and Evesham, on the river
which flows past Shakespeare's birthplace, is reached.</p>

<p class="location">EVESHAM</p>

<p>This picturesque little town owed its importance
to the great Benedictine abbey, which up to the
Dissolution had, according to Grose, such a great
assemblage of religious buildings that its equal was
not to be found out of Oxford and Cambridge.
Of these, however, there remain to-day only the
beautiful Perpendicular bell-tower, the almonry,
the mutilated Norman gatehouse, and the archway
leading to the chapter-house, now the entrance to
allotments. Many houses in the town are built of
stones from the destroyed abbey. The Booth Hall,
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>
in the market-place, is a charming old building, and
in the High Street and in Bridge Street there are
many fine old houses.</p>

<p>The two churches of Evesham stand in one
churchyard, and both were founded by the monks
of the abbey as secular chapels for the town. The
Church of St. Lawrence was practically rebuilt a
century ago, but All Saints, which existed in 1223,
has an Early English north aisle and chancel, and
examples of the succeeding periods in the other
parts of the building. The Battle of Evesham
was fought on August 4, 1265, rather less than a
mile from the town, on high ground to the north,
marked by an obelisk. Simon de Montfort, who
held Henry III. prisoner, was crushingly defeated
by Prince Edward, and both he and his son Henry
were killed, their bodies being buried in Evesham
Abbey Church before the high-altar.</p>

<p class="location">TEWKESBURY</p>

<p>is the last place passed through on this extensive
loop, and going in this direction one finds the best
wine reserved to the last, for this exceptionally
picturesque old town, with its solemn abbey
church, surrounded by tall ancient trees, and the
sweet green meadows, where Severn and Avon are
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>
only separated by a belt of level greensward, is one
of those places that have a way of fixing themselves
in the memory, even if one has never read Miss
Mulock's 'John Halifax, Gentleman.' If one has
done so, and remembers the descriptions of 'Norton
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>
Bury,' the old town will never be forgotten. One
can hardly think of Tewkesbury without the
dominating presence of its great Norman abbey
church, but even without it the long street contains
so many delightful sixteenth-century houses,
each possessing individual charms, that the town
would still make an irresistible appeal to all for
whom the architecture of the vanished centuries
has some message.</p>

<p>The founder of the present abbey was Robert
FitzHamon, who was related to William the
Conqueror, and received the Honour of Gloucester
from Rufus. Having decided to rebuild the
modest Saxon abbey, FitzHamon soon removed
all traces of the early buildings when, in 1102,
the work was begun. Five years later the founder
died of a wound received during a siege of the
impregnable castle of Falaise in Normandy, and
was buried in the chapter-house. The consecration
took place in 1123, and in 1178 a fire occurred,
which was fortunately restricted to the conventual
buildings.</p>

<p>Gilbert de Clare, one of the barons who had
signed Magna Charta, was buried in the abbey, and
after him, for two and a half centuries, every one of
his successors was laid to rest in the same building.
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></p>

<p>When Tewkesbury Abbey was suppressed, the
nave, which had always been secular, continued to
be a possession of the town, and the other portions
of the great fabric were bought from the Crown
for the sum of £453.</p>

<p>It is often stated that the great Norman tower is
the most perfect in this country, but the people of
St. Albans would no doubt question this claim.
The tall wooden spire, covered with lead, fell
during service on Easter Sunday in 1559, and was
never replaced. Inside the church one sees little
that is not pure Norman, and for solemnity and
vast, imposing dignity it would be difficult to find
any building able to overshadow Tewkesbury. It
may be compared with Durham, Selby, and Christchurch.
The west end has a wonderfully fine
recessed window of immense proportions. In 1661
the window was blown in during a gale, and was
replaced in 1686. Surely those who were attached
to the Commonwealth must have thought there
was something significant in this parallel to the
rending of the veil of the Temple, for the seventeenth
century was a superstitious age.</p>

<p>The Battle of Tewkesbury, one of the decisive
encounters of the Wars of the Roses, was fought,
in 1471, on the south side of the town (its
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>
position is shown in the accompanying plan).
Edward IV. crushingly defeated the Lancastrians
under Edward, the youthful Prince of Wales,
whose army fought with Tewkesbury in their
rear. The defeated army took refuge in the town,
and the slaughter continued in the abbey church
in hideous fashion, until the abbot, bearing in his
hands the consecrated elements, brought the fighting
to a close. Prince Edward, who had been
struck in the mouth by the gauntleted hand of
the King, was killed in a house in Church Street.</p>

<p>With the rooks cawing high overhead in the
tree-tops, and a sweet solemnity pervading the
whole abbey precincts, it is almost impossible to
picture the ghastly scene of civil war which, four
and a half centuries ago, soaked the meadows in
human blood and turned the noble church into a
shambles. For a month no services were held in
the building while every blood-stain was removed.</p>

<p>On the way back to Gloucester one could make
a very profitable detour of a few miles to Deerhurst
Priory, a highly interesting pre-Norman building,
until recently used as part of a farm, but lately
restored in a most efficient manner.

<p class="location">CHELTENHAM</p>

<p>Cheltenham stands close to the steep, north-west
face of the Cotswold Hills, and until the springs
were discovered in 1716 it was but a struggling
hamlet. It is now an aggregation of imposing
squares, crescents, promenades, and villas, interspersed
with beautiful parks. As may be expected,
there are few antiquities to be found in a town of
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>
such mushroom growth, the only exception being
the <span class="wider">Parish Church of St. Mary</span>, standing just off
the High Street. The prevailing style of the
building is early Decorated, and it contains a
piscina believed to be one of the largest and most
perfect in England. To those interested in modern
architecture the <span class="wider">Church of St. Stephen</span> may be
mentioned, but <span class="wider">All Saints'</span>, the parish church of
Pittville, is the best modern expression of architectural
ideals in Cheltenham, although the <span class="wider">Roman
Catholic Church of St. Gregory</span> is a formidable
rival. The public buildings are on a level with the
importance of the town. The merits and uses of
the chalybeate and other waters are easily discovered
locally, and no one who remembers the
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>
oft-repeated epitaph of the individual who with
three daughters 'died from drinking the Cheltenham
waters' should be prejudiced against their
good properties, which for certain ailments are not
to be despised. Cheltenham is a famous educational
centre for girls, and Gloucestershire, as a
whole, has been in the van in educational matters
from quite early times.</p>

<p>Cheltenham is the 'Coltham' in 'John Halifax,
Gentleman,' where John and Phineas saw Mrs.
Siddons act.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The road to Oxford from Cheltenham crosses
the beautiful Cotswolds, climbing up to 800 feet at
the Puesdown Inn. From this point there are
wide expanses visible in nearly every direction;
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>
but such views do not give one the real charm of
the Cotswolds. To become intimate with the
exquisite valleys and secluded upland villages, one
must be in a mood to potter and loiter, and be
content to desert the car at intervals in order to
plunge into some beautiful beech-wood, falling
steeply down a declivity, and revealing glimpses
between the tall smooth trunks of the Vale of
Severn, or some sleepy hollow wherein a silver-grey
village nestles. The beautiful architecture of
the Cotswolds, in conjunction with its lovely scenery,
is a joy to all who know these oolite hills. Cottages,
farms, mills, and manor-houses, all with steep
roofs of grey stone like the walls, stately gables,
mullioned windows, and picturesque chimneys, are
all one can desire.</p>

<p>Even if there is no time to wander from the
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>
direct road, one cannot avoid seeing an exceedingly
pleasing little Cotswold town. This is</p>

<p class="location">NORTHLEACH,</p>

<p>a place of some importance when the woollen
industry of these hills was flourishing. There is a
subtle charm in the greyness of the old houses,
relieved by the dark green of yew and the lighter
tones of deciduous trees and grass banks here and
there. The quaint little shops add other touches
of colour, and wherever one turns there are
pictures of simple Cotswold life, not much altered
by the rapid changes of recent years. The old
fellow standing meditatively by the churchyard
gate may talk of the great changes since his
youth, when the cloth industry had not ebbed
away from the hills, but to outward appearances
Northleach is, one suspects, little altered since
the days of our great-grandparents, if, indeed,
anything has materially changed the town since
the beautiful Perpendicular church was put up.
The date of its building was about the year 1489,
when Cotswold wool was one of the chief industries
of England. One may admire the embattled spire
and the graceful delicacy of the whole building,
but it is by its porch that one remembers Northleach
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>
Church. It is illustrated here; but, good
as the drawing is, it does not do justice to the
wonderful beauty of that noble piece of Perpendicular
craftsmanship surmounted by its parvise.</p>

<p>On the floor of the nave are a series of brasses to
the memory of some of the most successful of the
wool-merchants of the town. They belong to
the fifteenth century, and are exceptionally fine
examples of brasses of the period, giving the details
of costume with the greatest faithfulness. It is
pleasant to find that the wealthy men of the
Cotswold wool industry seem to have devoted their
surplus riches to such public works as schools,
almshouses, and churches.</p>

<p>At Northleach the Roman Foss Way is crossed
coming from Cirencester in a north-easterly direction.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond Northleach, <span class="wider">Sherborne
Park</span>, the residence of Lord Sherborne, is passed
on the left. It is a dignified house, situated in
open country, many portions of which are well
wooded.</p>

<p>From this point all the way to Witney the road
falls steadily, with the shallow, but always pleasing,
valley of the Windrush just below on the left.
This pretty stream coming out of the heart of the
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>
Cotswolds is one of the chief feeders of the
Thames, which it meets a dozen miles above
Oxford. Actually on the road there are no villages
except Little Minster between Northleach and
Witney, but just below the highway, on the
banks of the little river, there are several. The
first three&mdash;Windrush and Great and Little
Barrington&mdash;are in Gloucestershire, and the rest
are in Oxfordshire. It is tempting to describe all
these places, but one must be content with pointing
out the particular charm of</p>

<p class="location">BURFORD,</p>

<p>one of the most delightful of the old-world towns
of the county. There is a town hall, probably of
the fifteenth century, and adjoining it are some of
the best of the old houses in the town. Close to
the stream stands the splendid cruciform church,
with its tower and west door dating back to the
Norman period. In Early English times nearly
the whole building appears to have been changed
into the Gothic style, and another transformation
took place in the fifteenth century, when the
Perpendicular phase had set in. Owing to the
Sylvester aisle and several chapels, the church is of
curious shape, and this helps to give that indescribable
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>
atmosphere of pre-Reformation days entirely
vanished from so many old churches in this country.</p>

<p>Both the school and the almshouses are old
foundations, and the Priory, now a partial ruin,
although preserving no ecclesiastical remains, is a
picturesque Elizabethan building to some extent
rebuilt in 1808.</p>

<p>A mile or two beyond Burford one passes
Asthall Barrow on the right-hand side of the road,
and only a few yards away across a field. It
is a prehistoric mound of earth, now kept in
position by a circular retaining wall of stone, thus
preventing degradation. The trees surmounting it
form a prominent landmark. About three miles
farther on is the fine old manor-house of <span class="wider">Minster
Lovell</span>, about a mile to the left, on the Windrush.</p>

<p class="location">WITNEY</p>

<p>Soon after turning to the right the road enters
the main street of picturesque old Witney at right
angles. Extending away some distance to the
right is the pleasant elongated belt of green, giving
much charm and distinction to the place, and at the
end of the grassy perspective, rising in stately dignity
from old trees, appears the tower and spire of the
cruciform church. This is one of those peculiarly
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>
fascinating buildings one finds it hard to leave. It
is mainly an Early English church, but there are
features of other periods, and among them a
Decorated window on the north side, which is the
finest in the whole county. The spire is an Early
English masterpiece. In the middle of the little
town stands the quaint Butter Cross, dated 1683.
On the west side of the green is the Grammar
School (1663), with an avenue of elms.</p>

<p>The blanket industry is still in existence, for in
spite of modern competition the little place holds
its own on account of some particular benefit
the wool derives from the water of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="location">EYNSHAM</p>

<p>is the last village passed on the way to Oxford.
It is a sleepy and picturesque little place with
a small market hall, the shaft of a fifteenth-century
cross, and an inn-sign of the drollest order. This
sign hangs outside the Red Lion, and the King of
Beasts is painted on one side, but the draughtsman
had difficulty in accommodating the tail, and
he solved it by the original plan of painting the
caudal appendage on the opposite face of the
sign!
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></p>

<p>Just below Eynsham the road crosses the
Thames at Swinford Bridge, where the beautiful
hanging woods of Wytham Hill are on the left,
and a couple of miles farther on the spires and
towers of Oxford are in sight.

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Loop 8.</span> OXFORD TO COVENTRY.</p>
</div>

<p>There are two main roads running to Woodstock
from Oxford, lying parallel to each other; the
western one should be selected. It passes through
a well-wooded country, part of the valleys of the
Thames and Evenlode rivers. Upon reaching
Woodstock, <span class="wider">Blenheim Palace</span> claims attention,
with the entrance to the park lying upon the left.
The house was built at the public expense in 1715
as a national recognition of the services of the
Duke of Marlborough. It was designed by Vanbrugh,
and is of a heavy Renaissance character.
The interior decorations and the treasures preserved
in it are of an exceedingly interesting nature. (<i>It
is open to the public every day, except Saturdays
and Sundays, between 11 and 1, and the gardens
from 11 to 2. Tickets 1s. each.</i>) The park
contains the site of the old Manor-house of
Woodstock, which is supposed to have stood
upon the foundations of a Roman villa; it was a
royal residence of the Saxon kings. Here Alfred
the Great translated Boethius, and King Ethelred
published his code of laws. Woodstock was the
scene of the courtship of Henry II. and Rosamund
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>
Clifford, whose birthplace was Clifford Castle (see
<a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>). Queen Elizabeth was a prisoner for a
time in the old manor-house, and it endured a
siege from the Parliamentarians, finally disappearing
in 1723.</p>

<p class="location">WOODSTOCK</p>

<p>This little town sprang into existence solely in
consequence of the proximity of the royal seat.
<span class="wider">The Church of St. Mary Magdalene</span> is of
Norman date, but much restoration has taken
place. The south aisle is Early English, and contains
part of a Norman doorway. The chancel
and north aisle are Decorated, while the west porch
and west tower are Perpendicular. There are
many monuments of interest in the church.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Woodstock the Column of
Victory is prominent on the left, where the ancient
course of the Akeman Street, coming from Cirencester,
is crossed, and shortly afterwards Grim's
Dyke occurs, one of the many Grim's Dykes that
are found in England.</p>

<p>Near <span class="wider">Enstone</span> is a cromlech, called the 'Hoarstone,'
and soon afterwards a turning to the left
leads to</p>

<p class="location">CHIPPING NORTON</p>

<p>This is a quiet little town, devoted to the
manufacture of woollen goods, and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>
horse-cloths. The 'Chipping' is derived from the
same root as 'Chepe,' a market. In the church
the chief objects of interest are some fourteenth-century
brasses, which, however, suffered very
much in a restoration some forty years since,
when they were wrenched from their matrices and
thrown into the parvise. Of the castle which once
stood here nothing remains.</p>

<p>Between Chipping Norton and Long Compton,
at Great Rollright, are the well-known <span class="wider">Rollright
Stones</span>, consisting of a prehistoric circle of standing
stones and a cromlech. They are sixty in number,
and lie about 500 yards to the left of the main
road. After passing the stiff descent into Long
Compton, a good surface is found to Shipstone-on-Stour,
although the road is second class; but beyond
that town a first-class road lies up the valley of
the Stour to Stratford-on-Avon. At Alderminster
tram-lines commence, which reach to Stratford,
and a short distance beyond, Atherstone-on-Stour
is passed, where formerly stood a monastery
of mendicant friars. The scenery, meanwhile, has
been gradually assuming the characteristics which
distinguish the beautiful county of Warwick&mdash;luxurious
hedgerows, gently-flowing streams, red
loam in the fields contrasting with the varying
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>
shades of green. The half-timbered houses and
cottages introduce another pleasant feature into
the landscape.</p>

<p class="location">STRATFORD-ON-AVON</p>

<p>This far-famed country town on the banks of
the Avon presents a general appearance of prosperity,
the well-built houses, wide streets, and
prevailing aspect of cleanliness giving this impression.
Everything in the town, however, lapses
into insignificance in face of the paramount interest
attaching to the town as the birthplace of Shakespeare.
Whether the 'Bard of Avon' was nothing
more than an Elizabethan play-actor or the author
of the plays now so widely attributed to the great
scholar and statesman, Francis Bacon, is a question
which now cools the spirit of devotion of many a
pilgrim; but however keen a Baconian may be the
visitor to Stratford, he cannot fail to appreciate the
charm of the carefully-restored Elizabethan houses
associated with Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Shakespeare's Birthplace</span> is in Henley Street,
a half-timbered, unpretentious house of two rooms
and a kitchen on the ground-floor, with the room
overhead in which he was born. The adjoining
cottage has been converted into a museum, in
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>
which documents and relics bearing in a direct or
remote manner with the poet&mdash;and some, it must
be confessed, are very remote&mdash;are preserved. The
birthplace was in possession of the members of the
family for two centuries after the death of Shakespeare
in 1616; in 1847 it was purchased by
subscription for £3,000 and carefully restored.
(<i>Admission 1s.&mdash;6d. for the birthroom and 6d. for
the museum.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Town Hall</span> is in the High Street; on
the front is a statue of Shakespeare, presented by
Garrick.</p>

<p><span class="wider">New Place</span> stood close by, but of the house
occupied by the poet during the last nineteen
years of his life there is nothing left but the site.
In it lived Dr. Hall, who married Shakespeare's
daughter Susannah. The house was pulled down
in 1702 by Sir John Clopton, and the new building
on its site, together with the famous mulberry-tree,
were destroyed by the Rev. Francis Gastrell in
1759, 'because he was pestered by visitors'! In
1861 the site of New Place and its gardens were
purchased by public subscription. A Shakespeare
Library and Museum have been established there,
<i>open daily except Saturday and Sunday; admission
6d. On Saturday the Gardens are free</i>.

<p class="caption">STRATFORD-ON-AVON.<br />
Holy Trinity Church contains the tomb of Shakespeare.</p>
</div>

<p>At the opposite corner, Chapel Lane, stands
the <span class="wider">Grammar School</span>, founded in 1553, where
the poet is reputed to have been educated. It is
a delightful old timber-framed house standing
near the Guild Chapel, a Perpendicular building
which is conspicuous in the High Street.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</span> occupies
a pleasant position on the banks of the Avon.
The old theatre was demolished in 1872, and the
present building erected at a cost of £30,000.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Parish Church</span>, of Early English and
Perpendicular architecture, is a fine cruciform
building standing on the site of an early Saxon
monastery. In Edward III.'s reign John de
Stratford rebuilt the south aisle and erected a
chantry for priests. In 1351 Ralph de Stratford
built a chapel for the latter, now known as the
College. The beautiful choir dates from the time
of Dean Balshall (1465). Shakespeare's monument
is on the left side of the chancel; the door there
formerly led to the charnel-house, and the grave is
near the monument under a flat stone, upon which
is the oft-quoted verse said to have been written
by Shakespeare. Between this spot and the north
wall is buried his widow, who died in 1623, while
those of relatives lie near, such as Susannah, the
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>
eldest daughter, and her husband, Dr. Hall, and
Thomas Nashe, who married Shakespeare's only
granddaughter. (<i>Admission to the church 6d.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="wider">Anne Hathaway's Cottage</span> is at Shottery, a
mile west of Stratford, divided since the poet's
time into three tenements. The room where Anne
was born is shown.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Charlecote Park</span> lies about four miles north-east
of Stratford. It is famous for its hall, erected
in 1547 by Sir Thomas Lucy upon the capital E
plan, and was visited by Queen Elizabeth. Here
also is the reputed site of Shakespeare's deer-shooting
escapades.</p>

<p>The main road to Warwick lies through a
beautifully-wooded country, rich in pleasant views
of hill and dale. Clopton Tower is on the left
shortly after leaving.</p>

<p>The tower of Barford Church can be seen two
miles off to the right of the main road; it was
rebuilt in the last century, except the tower, which
retains the marks of Cromwellian cannon-balls.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Sherbourne</span> is near at hand. The church is
modern, and of fine design.</p>

</div>

<p class="location">WARWICK</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the history of Warwick
is the history of England, and certain it is that the
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>
ancient town has been involved in the majority of
the great events which have helped to make the
national record. In those stirring events <span class="wider">Warwick
Castle</span> has played no mean part, and is still the
glory of the town and county. It is undoubtedly
the most magnificent of the ancient feudal mansions
still used as a residence, and its grand position upon
a crag overlooking the Avon has accentuated its
imposing grandeur in no mean degree. Its chief
features are Cæsar's Tower and Guy's Tower, of
the fourteenth century, and the Gateway Tower in
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>
the centre. The residential apartments and the
Great Hall suffered in the fire of 1871, but have
been rebuilt. Both the castle and the contents
teem with interest. (<i>Open to visitors as a rule; no
fixed fee. Tickets obtained at small cottage opposite
Castle Lodge, Castle Hill.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Mary's Church</span> is one of the most interesting
ecclesiastical buildings in the country. A Saxon
church stood upon the site, and a later building
was made collegiate by Earl Roger de Newburgh.
It was granted to the town as a parish church at
the Dissolution. The central object of interest is
the famous Beauchamp Chapel, 1443 to 1464, one
of the best examples extant of Perpendicular architecture
bordering upon the Tudor, and showing
occasionally traces of incipient Renaissance. Richard
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Regent of France,
and guardian of Edward VI., lies buried here, and
his effigy in bronze, the finest in existence of that
nature, lies in the centre of the chapel. Against
the north wall is the magnificent monument of the
famous Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester&mdash;splendid
in life and sumptuous in death. Two small ante-chapels
are seen&mdash;one is probably a chantry. In
the chancel lie Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
and his second Countess, both of whom died
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>
in 1370; their effigies of white marble, with many
'weepers' round the pedestal, are of great interest.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Lord Leycester's Hospital.</span>&mdash;There are but
few places in England where such a picturesque
and impressive grouping of old timbered houses
may be seen; antique gables and eaves, richly-carved
beams and mysterious recesses; overhanging
stories and twisted chimneys, with an old gateway
and a church tower thrown in&mdash;it forms a gem of
which any city might be proud. The Hospital
was originally a hall of the Guilds; in 1571 the
Earl founded it for the reception of twelve poor
men, who still wear the bear and ragged staff
as a cognizance. Many half-timbered houses and
quaint old-world nooks remain in Warwick to
delight the eye of the artist and the antiquary,
especially near the castle.</p>

<a href="images/i-341l.jpg">View larger image</a>
</div>

<p class="location">LEAMINGTON</p>

<p>A little over a mile separates Warwick from the
Royal Leamington Spa, a beautiful garden city,
which has sprung into existence by reason of the
discovery of the efficacy possessed by the mineral
waters in 1784. Until that period it was a small
village called Leamington Priors. The chief springs
are saline and sulphuretted saline.
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></p>

<p>The <span class="wider">Jephson Gardens</span> are beautifully placed
on the north bank of the River Leam, and form
one of the chief centres of attraction, and the
Royal Pump Room Gardens face the river on
the other side of the bridge. As might be
expected from such a modern town, there are no
objects of antiquity to describe. Returning to
Warwick, the road to Guy's Cliff is taken,
running due north, and the entrance-lodge occurs
in about a mile. A fine view of the house
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>
is obtained from this point on looking up the
avenue of majestic firs; it was built in 1822,
succeeding a small country mansion, and is in the
possession of Lord Algernon Percy. Situated upon
a cliff with a wide part of the river beneath, it
forms a singularly beautiful picture. (<i>It is only
shown to visitors when the family is absent.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Chapel</span> adjoins the mansion on the east,
and contains a figure of Guy, Earl of Warwick,
dating from the fourteenth century. Guy's Lane
is near the chapel.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Mill</span> was built in 1821, and occupies the
site of one dating as far back as Saxon times.</p>

<p>Guy of Warwick is a mythical personage, and
the romance mentioning his deeds dates from the
thirteenth century. In the fifteenth century, when
the age of chivalry and romance was at its zenith,
Guy was treated in the same manner as King
Arthur, and all kinds of doughty deeds were attributed
to him by the romancers.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Blacklow Hill</span> stands half a mile farther on to
the left of the road. It is surmounted by a cross,
erected in 1821 to commemorate the execution in
1312 of Piers Gaveston. At Gloucester, the tomb
of Edward II., who, like his favourite, came to a
tragic end, has been mentioned.
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></p>

<p class="location">KENILWORTH</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Castle</span> is the centre of attraction, although
there are some good examples of half-timbered
cottages to be seen in the long street of the little
town. The fortress was in ancient times one of the
strongest in England, as it afforded accommodation
for a large garrison, and by reason of the lake
and broad moats filled with water&mdash;now disappeared&mdash;it
was almost impregnable. Numerous roads
converged towards it as the centre of England,
and for many years it was a royal residence. <span class="wider">The
Keep</span> was built about 1170, and is a splendid
example of military architecture of the late Norman
period. It is square, with a projecting rectangle,
and turrets at the corners. The walls at the
base are 14 feet thick. <span class="wider">The Garden</span>, celebrated
in Scott's novel, lay upon the north side of the
keep. South of the keep occur Leicester's Buildings,
with fourteenth-century kitchens and other
offices between. By the side of the Great Hall was
the Strong Tower, called Mervyn's Tower by Scott.
Mortimer's Tower is isolated to the south-east;
the cutting through the great dam which restrained
the waters of the lake occurred here. The tilt-yard
lay upon the top of the dam. Beyond the Great
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>
Lake was the <span class="wider">Chase</span>, and the circuit of the castle,
manor, parks and other lands, was about twenty
miles. Many historical names are associated with
Kenilworth&mdash;the Clintons, Simon de Montfort,
John of Gaunt, and Robert Dudley, who entertained
Queen Elizabeth for seventeen days, and
spent a fortune in doing so. The castle was
dismantled and the lake drained in the time of
the Commonwealth.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="wider">The Church</span> lies east of the castle. The tower
and nave are of Decorated work, but a Norman
doorway has been inserted in the west side of the
tower, taken, probably, from the Priory.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Priory</span> stood close to the church; it was
founded about 1122 by Geoffrey de Clinton, and
richly endowed. The remains of a gatehouse may
be seen, and also some exposed foundations of the
walls of the church.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>On leaving Kenilworth for Coventry a stretch of
moorland extends upon the right hand, on which
are two mounds with the usual fosses around the
summits, denoting British hill-forts. Beyond this
the road begins to assume that characteristic which
has made the way from Kenilworth to Coventry
renowned as 'one of the two finest roads in
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>
England'&mdash;needless to say, the other road is from
Coventry to Kenilworth&mdash;a magnificent avenue
with broad strips of greensward lying on either side,
and glimpses of splendid Warwickshire scenery
between the boles, justify the foregoing descriptions.</p>

<p>Two miles from Kenilworth is Gibbet Hill, the
erection upon which has now gone, but was used
last in 1765 for the execution of two murderers.
Crossing Stivichall Common, with its triple array
of oak-trees on either side the road, the Coventry
Grammar School buildings are passed upon the left,
and the 'City of the Three Spires' is entered.</p>

<p class="location">COVENTRY</p>

<p>The city derives its name from Conventre, or
Convent Town, in recognition of the Benedictine
monastery erected by Leofric and Godiva in 1043.
The well-known legend connected with these famous
personages need only be referred to here. <span class="wider">Gosford
Green</span>, outside the town, was the scene of the
historical encounter between the Dukes of Hereford
and Norfolk in the reign of Richard II., which had
such momentous results. Many Parliaments have
been held in the town, and it was famous for the
great number of religious communities which
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>
during the medieval period were lodged in the
town. The ancient fortifications were dismantled
in the time of Charles II. as a punishment for the
Commonwealth tendencies of the citizens.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Michael's Church</span>, a 'masterpiece of art,'
and one of the finest parish churches in England,
stands in the centre of the city. It is in the
Perpendicular style, and has been recently restored.
The spire is 303 feet high, and was begun in 1372;
flying buttresses of great elegance support the
tower. The oldest part of the church is the
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>
south porch, with a parvise over it. The chapels
belonging to the various guilds in the town still
retain their old names. There are many effigies,
but none of great antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Holy Trinity Church</span> is adjacent to St.
Michael's. The date of foundation is unknown;
the style is late Early English, and the work by
the north porch dates from <i>c.</i> 1259. The porch
has a domus, or priest's chamber, over it. There
are several chapels in the church devoted to the
city guilds. The foundations and remains noticed
on the north side of the church are those of the
west front of the cathedral, built about 1260
upon a preceding Norman foundation. It was
the Priory Church of the monastery founded by
Leofric, and was demolished at the Reformation.</p>

<p><span class="wider">St. Mary's Hall</span>, near St. Michael's, was begun
in 1394, and belonged to three guilds. It is of very
great interest, and should on no account be passed
by. The great hall, crypt, tapestry, ancient glass
windows, and knaves' post, are all objects worthy
of attention, while the building generally is a vivid
reminder of medieval life and feeling.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Bablake Hospital</span>, founded in 1560, is close to
St. John's Church, and presents some picturesque
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>
examples of half-timber construction with quaint
gables.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Peeping Tom</span> is a prominent feature of the
King's Head Hotel in Smithford Street, and
<span class="wider">Ford's Hospital</span>, down Greyfriar's Lane, possesses
an extremely fine façade and a charming timbered
court rich in carved oak and diamond-paned
windows.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The road to Southam and Banbury leaves
Coventry as the London Road, and about two
miles to the south <span class="wider">Whitley Abbey</span> is reached,
formerly the seat of Lord Hood, son of the famous
Admiral. In Whitley Abbey Charles I. resided
while conducting operations against Coventry in
1622. On Whitley Common are traces of earthworks
thrown up by the Royalists. Baginton,
lying about two miles to the right, contains the
remains of an ancient castle. Shortly after Whitley
the road divides, the one going to Southam being
that upon the right. A turning shortly afterwards
at the cross-roads leads to the well-known <span class="wider">Stoneleigh
Abbey</span>, lying five miles to the west, the site
of a former castle and of a subsequent foundation
for Cistercian monks, which was dispossessed at
the Reformation. Some remains of the castle
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>
exist, but the present building is an imposing
range of buildings in the classic style, and forms,
with the grounds, one of the most splendid country
homes in the kingdom. It is the seat of Lord
Leigh.</p>

<p><span class="wider">Long Itchington</span> has some fine half-timbered
houses, and is a picturesque village. <span class="wider">The Church</span>
was rebuilt in the fourteenth century by the Priors
of Maxstoke. In the eighteenth century the spire
was damaged by lightning; hence its present
truncated appearance. The aisle is part of the
original church, and is Early English except the
doorway, which dates from the Norman period.
There are some very interesting details to be found
in the interior, notably the chancel screen, which
is an extremely rare example of early fourteenth-century
woodwork. St. Wolstan, the last of the
Saxon Bishops, was a native of this place. Long
Itchington was honoured by two visits from Queen
Elizabeth during her progresses to Kenilworth.
Two miles farther on is <span class="wider">Southam</span>, of no particular
interest, although the church may perhaps repay a
casual inspection. The road lies through a pleasant
district, essentially Midland in its general aspects,
but near the road turning off to Fenny Compton
higher ground is reached. <span class="wider">Cropredy</span>, where the
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>
battle was fought in 1644, is one and a half miles
to the east by the turning close to Mollington.</p>

<p class="location">BANBURY</p>

<p>Banbury is chiefly known by reason of its cross
and its cakes. The former has been destroyed, but
a replica exists upon the site. It is a small borough
of about 4,000 inhabitants, and was formerly a
notable place for the manufacture of plush, but
now produces agricultural implements and portable
engines. A castle was built here in 1125, but it
was entirely destroyed in the <span class="wider">Civil War</span>. The
moat, however, may still be traced. In 1469 the
common men of Yorkshire, to the number of about
16,000, marched to Banbury under the leadership
of 'Robin of Redesdale,' and captured the Earl of
Pembroke, after inflicting a defeat upon him on the
borders of Oxford. A college and hospital formerly
existed in the town. The church is of comparatively
modern construction, having been thoroughly rebuilt
about a century ago.</p>

<p>Leaving Banbury, the little village of <span class="wider">Adderbury</span>
possesses a church the chancel of which
was built by William of Wykeham. Passing the
Astons, North, Mid, and Steeple, we come to the
junction of roads leading respectively to Woodstock
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>
and Oxford, and at this point a Roman road&mdash;the
Akeman Street&mdash;crosses the route, running
between Cirencester and Bicester. In the course
of a few miles the outlying portions of Oxford
appear in view.

<p class="location">OXFORD</p>

<p>The entrance to the 'city of palaces' is through
suburbs of a commonplace, uninteresting, or even
ugly character, the builders having apparently
gained no inspiration from the magnificent examples
of architecture which they are gradually hemming
in. That such squalid, or, at the best, perky and
meretricious streets of houses should have been
allowed to encompass the architectural splendours
of the great University is a public scandal, and it is
to be hoped that before many years have passed
some steps will be taken to wipe out the worst of
these new abominations. To adequately describe
Oxford within the limits of this work is impossible,
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>
and it will be sufficient to indicate the salient features
which should not be passed over. The city lies upon
a low ridge between the Thames and the Cherwell,
and is surrounded by a fine range of hills. The
imposing array of towers and spires, the many
colleges with their historic quadrangles, the avenues
and groves and secluded college gardens, the marvellous
profusion of carved stonework, all combine
to render the nucleus of this ancient seat of learning
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>
one of the most beautiful in the British Empire.
<span class="wider">The Bodleian Library</span> is the hub round which
the colleges cluster, and after it has been seen the
church of <span class="wider">St. Mary the Virgin</span> should be visited,
from its long connection with the seat of learning.
Near it are the New Schools, the Botanic Garden,
and the Clarendon Press, while the Taylor building
contains many interesting pictures. Of the colleges,
All Souls, Balliol, Brasenose, Christ Church, Magdalen,
Merton, and New College, are among the
most interesting.</p>

<p><span class="wider">The Cathedral</span> belonging to Christ Church
dates from 1160, and is a noble example of Norman
architecture. <span class="wider">The nave</span> is pure Norman, <span class="wider">the
chancel</span> Transitional, <span class="wider">the chapter-house</span> Early
English. <span class="wider">The shrine of St. Frideswide</span>, <span class="wider">the
Bishop's throne</span>, and the grand modern reredos,
are particularly notable.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The first village passed after leaving Oxford is
<span class="wider">Sandford-on-Thames</span>, but the flatness of the
country and the presence of a paper-mill with a
tall chimney deprive the place of any particular
charm beyond what is found in the quietest reaches
of the Upper Thames. Sandford Church is not
interesting, but there are remains of a preceptory
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>
of Knights Templars at the farm by the brook
a little to the north-west.</p>

<p>The road continues parallel with the river, and
soon passes through the curiously uniform village
of <span class="wider">Nuneham Courtney</span>. The two lines of picturesque
cottages facing one another across the
road were built by the first Earl Harcourt, who,
disliking the proximity of the village to the manor-house,
razed the cottages to the ground after constructing
the new ones, which have now been
sufficiently toned down by the weather to give a
pleasing effect. This same building Earl demolished
the old church and erected another near the house,
now abandoned for a new one lately put up near
the village. He also rebuilt the house (<i>not shown
to visitors</i>) in the severely classic style in vogue
at the close of the eighteenth century. The grounds
and gardens were laid out in part by the popular
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>
'Capability' Brown, and these may be seen on
Tuesdays and Thursdays in the summer. <i>It is
advisable, however, if one particularly wishes to see
them, to write in advance to Mr. H. Gale, Nuneham
Courtney.</i></p>

<p>About a mile beyond the village, at the cross-roads,
there formerly stood a little hostelry called
the Golden Ball. It acquired a bad reputation
through the murder of a guest by his servant.
The landlord, having been found with a knife in
his hand in the dead man's bedroom, was condemned
to death and hanged, but later on the servant confessed
that he had committed the murder which the
landlord had intended.</p>

<p class="location">DORCHESTER</p>

<p>is a dreamy old village, beautifully placed upon
the River Thames. It contains many quaint
timbered houses, some with thatched roofs, and
nearly all with some attractive features which
make it hard to tear oneself away from the
place. The chief object of interest, apart from
the cottage architecture, is the huge church, so
strangely out of place in such a hamlet. Dorchester,
however, has a history stretching right
back to the British period. During the Roman
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>
occupation the camp here was supposed to be
called <i>Dourcastrum</i>, altered into Dorchester in
the Saxon period, but this Roman name is uncertain.
When Dorchester was the seat of the
Saxon bishopric of Wessex, the see included about
twenty English counties, but Remigius, the first
Norman Bishop, transferred it to Lincoln in 1085.
The Saxon church, built in 1036, was occupied as a
monastic church in 1140, when a monastery of the
Augustinians was founded. In 1200, and also in
1350, extensive additions were made. In the
church the Jesse window on the north side is
unique, for the figures are carved in stone. The
east window is a remarkable example of Decorated
work; there is a massive buttress in the centre,
and the whole of the spaces are occupied by reticulated
tracery. The recumbent effigies, dating from
1200 to 1410, are very interesting, while a brass
of the Henry V. period lies in the floor. The
furnishing of the interior savours so much of the
Roman church that one might easily imagine
oneself on the other side of the Channel. One
notices a bell conspicuous on the altar steps, and
'sacred' pictures, with candles and half-withered
floral offerings in front of them, are placed on the
pillars and elsewhere! Is the Bishop of Oxford
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>
aware of these strange reversions to the practices
condemned by the Protestant Church of England
for the last four centuries? The leaden font is of
Norman workmanship, and is a comparatively rare
object. In the churchyard stands a cross with a
restored head.</p>

<p>The ascent of the Chilterns is very gradual,
becoming steeper, however, in places, and delightful
views are obtained over the surrounding
country. The quaint little village of Nettlebed
stands upon the summit (1,650 feet above sea-level),
and thence the descent to Henley commences.
Near Nettlebed many cultivated downs
are to be seen, their rounded summits crowned
as a rule with plantations&mdash;a contrast in this
respect with the bare South Downs. These
rounded knolls are all that denudation has left
of the tertiary sand deposits on the chalk. In
many parts beeches flourish, and occasionally brick
and timber cottages of quaint aspect are passed.</p>

<p class="location">HENLEY-ON-THAMES</p>

<p>is a charming old town, apart altogether from the
prominent position it holds in the boating world,
owing to the magnificent reach of the Thames
which occurs here. There are many picturesque
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>
old houses in the wide, sunny street, and, as at
Dorchester, the artist and architect will find much
to attract their attention. <span class="wider">The Church</span>, standing
out boldly near the bridge, possesses an Early
English chancel, and the oldest part of the nave
is of the same date. Nearly everything else,
including the flint tower, is Tudor. A monument
to Lady Elizabeth Periam, a sister of Lord Bacon
and the mistress of Greenlands (died 1621), is
under the tower. There are two hagioscopes and
a priest's entrance to the vanished rood-loft. The
bridge, with open stone parapets, was built in
1786, after the old one had been carried away by
a flood. It is, therefore, much older than the
regatta, which was first held in 1839.</p>

<p>The road between Henley-on-Thames and
Maidenhead crosses the ground lying in a loop
of the Thames, gradually rising from Henley
and falling towards Maidenhead. The numerous
turnings should be taken with care. About two
miles before reaching Maidenhead the Bath road
is joined.</p>

<p class="location">MAIDENHEAD</p>

<p>is more a centre for river excursions and boating-parties
than a place of any attractiveness in itself.
It might easily be mistaken for one of the better
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>
suburbs of London, and contains practically nothing
of interest. The great railway-bridge, with spans
of 128 feet, was designed by Brunel.</p>

<p class="location">ETON</p>

<p>On the left of the High Street, leading to the
bridge facing Windsor, are the picturesque Tudor
buildings and the huge chapel of Eton College. The
great courtyard, surrounded by beautifully mellowed
ranges of red-brick buildings on three sides and the
chapel on the south, is delightfully picturesque;
and the chapel itself, with its enormous buttresses
and lovely Perpendicular details, is a noble work
within and without. A statue of Henry VI., the
founder, stands in the centre of the large courtyard.
The famous playing-fields, where it is
generally understood that those qualities which
won the Battle of Waterloo were developed,
extend down to the Thames.</p>

<p class="location">WINDSOR</p>

<p>As one crosses the bridge, the long, imposing line
of the castle walls and towers frowns above the red
roofs of the little town, generally described as the
Royal Borough of Windsor. A steep street winds
up to the castle gateway, and as one approaches
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>
nearer, the work of Wyatville on the huge pile
becomes painfully apparent. In vain does one
look for the slightest indication that the whole
of the great fortress, including the conspicuous
Round Tower, was not built yesterday. This is
the tragedy of Windsor, and after the first general
glance one learns to expect nothing that tells its
age by its masonry or its weathering. Everything,
except the timber and brick Horseshoe Cloisters, is
encased in harsh grey stone of a drearily uniform
grey.</p>

<p>The way into London from Kingston-on-Thames is over Putney Heath and across
Putney Bridge, where it is only necessary to follow the motor omnibuses to reach
Hyde Park Corner or any other central point.]
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a></p>

<p>It was probably William the Conqueror who
built the first fortress on the wonderfully defensive
site raised above the Thames, but Henry III., the
builder of Westminster Abbey and much of the
Tower of London, who planned the castle on its
present vast scale. Edward III., having instituted
the Order of the Garter, gave up the lower ward
to that distinguished body of knights, and it was
he who employed William of Wykeham as his
architect or surveyor. The third, and practically
the last, great builder was George IV., who gave
up the historic buildings, then in bad repair, to the
tender mercies of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, with the
results already deplored.</p>

<p>(<i>The State apartments may be seen during the
absence of the Court, but about a week elapses after
the Royal departure before the public are admitted.</i>)</p>

<p>The magnificent Chapel of St. George&mdash;one of
the three finest Perpendicular chapels in the
kingdom&mdash;was mainly built by Edward IV., and
finished by Henry VII. and VIII. In the choir
are the stalls of the Knights of the Garter,
twenty-six in number, with their banners above.
Edward IV., Henry VI., Henry VIII., and Jane
Seymour and Charles I., were all buried in the
chapel.
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a></p>

<p><span class="wider">Windsor Park</span> is famous for the Long Walk&mdash;three
straight miles of elms, planted by Charles II.;
for the beautiful artificial lake, known as Virginia
Water; and for the mausoleum in the grounds of
Frogmore House, where Queen Victoria and the
good Prince Consort lie buried. (<i>On one day only&mdash;December
14&mdash;every year is this open to the public.</i>)</p>

<p>The road keeps near the river, and passes close to
historic Magna Charta Island, where the unwilling
John Lackland signed the great charter of English
liberty in 1215.</p>

<p class="location">STAINES</p>

<p>possesses an important bridge, the descendant of
a wooden one which stood there in 1262. The
stone bridge, put up in 1792, gave way, and its
successor, built in 1803, was a bold engineering
feat in the form of a single iron span of 180 feet;
but this, too, had to be replaced, and in 1829 the
present stone bridge was planned. It was opened
in 1832 by William IV. and Queen Adelaide.</p>

<p>After passing the picturesque Hampton Court
Green, one reaches Wolsey's magnificent red-brick
palace&mdash;</p>

<p class="location">HAMPTON COURT</p>

<p>The site had been in the possession of the Knights
of St. John of Jerusalem, and it was from the Prior
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>
that Cardinal Wolsey obtained a lease in 1514.
He demolished the manor-house, then standing,
and in its place planned the stately palace, with
its several courtyards entered by great gateways of
red brick and stone. Here the princely ecclesiastic
entertained in a manner so sumptuous that the
Court of Henry VIII. was outshone by its brilliance.
In 1526, the King having commented on this fact,
Wolsey promptly handed over his palace to his
royal master, who did not hesitate to accept a gift
so pleasing. After Wolsey's death, Henry spent
much time at Hampton Court, and rebuilt a large
part of the palace.</p>

<p>To chronicle a bare summary of historic events
which took place in the castle is not possible here,
but in the early period of its existence Edward VI.
was born there, and within these old red walls
Jane Seymour died, Catherine Howard was disgraced,
and Catherine Parr was married. Here,
too, Charles I. spent his honeymoon, and afterwards
was confined as a prisoner for three months.</p>

<p class="location">KINGSTON-ON-THAMES</p>

<p>on the other side of the river, is a busy little town
of some picturesqueness, possessing at one end of
its narrowing market-place the famous <span class="wider">Coronation</span>
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>
<span class="wider">Stone</span> from which the place derives its name.
The Perpendicular church, which is large and
contains a monument by Chantrey, used to have
a quaint custom of cracking nuts during the services
on the Sunday preceding Michaelmas Eve. So
great was the noise of crunching nuts that it was
almost impossible to hear the voice of the clergyman.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>After ascending Kingston Hill the road crosses
Putney Heath, and enters the Metropolis through
the now uninteresting suburb of Putney. After
crossing Putney Bridge, the motor omnibuses are
the best guide to follow.
